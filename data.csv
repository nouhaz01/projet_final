That's absurd! That statement must therefore say that any argument in favor
of seatbelts or airbags is an argument against automobiles.  Any argument
for lifeguards is an argument against swimming.  It says that any agrgument
in favor of safety precautions is an argument for banning the activity to 
which the precautions apply.  Extrapolating to that degree is ridiculous,
there wouldn't be any normal human activity left to do; therefore it is
a non-seqitur.

Also, even though most people do not ride motorcycles, they do boat, sail,
jetski, climb, ski, fly parachute, hang-glide, glide, bungee-jump, bike,
skate, rollerblade, skateboard, play rugby (ouch), mow the lawn, rewire
the basement, operate heavy machinery,  and do a host of other 'dangerous'
things that would all be as valid as motorcycling as activities to ban.
Your little homily applies to all those things, and the general public
buying into banning motorcycles without realizing that their activity
would be next is unlikely.

"I've been running Dos 6 for about a month.  I was generally impressed with
the improvements:  the multiple boot configurations were great, the
new commands were nice, and DoubleSpace worked fine (twice as slow for
large data transfers, twice as fast for small with SmartDrv).

Until now.

This morning at 4 am while I was working on my research paper, I had to
reboot a hung Dos program (that did no disk i/o) from within Windows 3.1.
When my machine finished rebooting, I found my windows directory and about two
thirds of my other directories were irreversibly corrupted.

I cannot afford problems like this.  I'm returning to Dos 5.

Could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of

No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity.
Palestinians are no exception. Perhaps you heard about
anti-trust in the business world.

Since we are debating the legality of a commercial
transaction, we must use the laws governing the guidelines
and ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law says
that, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of
investing, you can not acquire a large number of those
shares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so
only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly,
the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some
designs, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate.
They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.

The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the
old tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic /
multi-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbours
was no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fair
market value, etc... They did not know they were victims of
an international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theorist
myself, but this one is hard to dismiss).




Again Adam, the devil is in the details. I don't want to get
on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its
OK to return 100 deportes and leave the rest. Because 100 is
a nice number that you can devide by 10, 100 and besides, it
has an integer square root.



Do you actually believe this? My experience tells me that
every palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home, in
Palestine. Besides they often refer to their exodus as an
escape from hell (so to speak). I know none that agrees with
you. Did you sample their opinions? I know you don't care,
just being rethorical.




Don't get me wrong. I beleive that Israel is democratic
within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (Jews).
Israel probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic
cleansing Serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the
international community, or make the best out of a no win
condition: show the world how good Israel is towards the
'bad' arabs. Personaly, I've never heard anything about the
arab community in Isreal. Except that they're there.  So
yes, they're there. But as a community with history and
roots, its dead.






I stand corrected. I meant that the jewish culture was not
predominant in Palestine in recent history. I have no
problem with Jerusalem having a jewish character if it were
predominantly Jewish. So there. what to make of the rest
Palestine?

Because, the x-Soviet Armenian government got away with the genocide 
of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the 
fruits of that genocide. And they are doing 'it' again. Are you so 
blind?


Kurds 'R' us; Armenians 'R' not.


Excuse me?

 ""We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
  ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
  of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. 
  Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts 
  into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
  and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
  completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They 
  found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
  into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole 
  length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
  Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
  plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
  Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for 
  howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
  scattered bones of the dead.""

A genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an 
attempt to exterminate a race. This is the worst crime in history. 
It happened to the Turks in eastern Anatolia and the Armenian 
dictatorship. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were killed in the worst 
ways imaginable. It is sickening to think that the human race is capable 
of such actions, but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian 
genocide of 2.5 million Muslims happened.

People of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were 
killed in the Turkish genocide. I understand their anger that there 
are those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place, 
despite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million Turks has been 
well documented over the past six decades. We cannot reverse
the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to keep the
memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as
to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people
because of their religion or their race.

Why not?


And the Germans were subject to Jewish Genocide? Are you for real? 
Tell me 'Halsall', were you high on ""ASALA/SDPA/ARF"" forgeries and
fabrications when you wrote that? Where is your non-existent list
of scholars. Here is mine: During the First World War and the ensuing 
years - 1914-1920, the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated 
and systematic genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy 
of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 
2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year 
homeland.

The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

  Mark Alan Epstein, 'The Ottoman Jewish Communities and their Role
  in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries,' Klaus Schwarz Werlag,
  Freiburg (1980).

  page 19:

 <<During the fifteenth century, when the Ottomans were struggling to
  reestablish themselves in the Balkans, there was considerable turmoil
  among the Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe. Even if
  the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the
  fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which
  Ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in Europe, held for the
  Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the
  realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans, but with each account of persecution
  in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews
  fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that
  the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that
  there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and
  eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the
  effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and
  persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection
  of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,
  was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>>


  page 21:

  <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official
  in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi
  Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and
  the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation
  of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from
  Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two
  recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom
  of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European
  coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.
  This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant
  conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of
  travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who
  would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*)


  page 41:

 <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were
 firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them
 and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians
 of Europe.

 Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is
 also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews
 as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation.
 Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians
 representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European
 sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition
 it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews,''  their
 sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who
 regularly reported to the Ottomans.

 There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans
 in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances
 of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited
 instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the
 early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy
 for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman
 document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some
 Greek towns...>>

 page 43:

  <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally
 accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently,
 and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of
 the situation.>>


 page 46:

 <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not
 particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common, few common
 interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition
 which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. If
 there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between
 religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was
 that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with
 the Orthodox.>>

 page 46:

 <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context
 during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of
 interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed
 Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already
 existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish
 response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian
 countries to Ottoman domains.>>

 page 151:

  <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the
  Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would
  characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,
  in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and
  the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions
  elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the
  Jews recognized their mutual interests...>>

  page 161:

  <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success
  of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success
  in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both
  cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough
  to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success
  without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve
  the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is, however, unmistakably clear
  that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable
  partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived.
  We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their
  success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the
  Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
  the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>>


(*) A version of Rabbi Sarfati's [Tzarfati] letter is given by Prof.Shaw:

  page 32:

  <<Your cries and sobs reached us. We have been told of all the troubles
  and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands....I hear
  the lamentation of my brethren...The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly
  oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...The priests and
  prelates of Rome have risen. They wish to root out the memory of Jacob
  and erase the name of Israel. They always devise new persecutions. They
  wish to bring you to the stake...Listen my brethren, to the counsel I will
  give you. I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German
  rabbis. I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land,
  which is blessed by God and filled with all good things. Here I found rest
  and happiness; Turkey can also become for you the land of peace...If you
  who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with
  in this land, you would not consider any difficulties; you would set out
  to come to us...Here in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain
  of. We possess great fortunes; much gold and silver in our hands. We are
  not oppressed with heavy taxes, and our commerce is free and unhindered.
  Rich are the fruits of the earth. Everything is cheap, and every one of us
  lives in peace and freedom. Here the Jew is not compelled to wear a yellow
  hat as a badge of shame, as is the case in Germany, where even wealth and
  great fortune are a curse for a Jew because he therewith arouses jealousy
  among the Christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him
  to rob him of his gold. Arise my brethren, gird up your loins, collect
  your forces, and come to us. Here you will be free of your enemies, here
  you will find rest...>>[13]

Computer Graphics Resource Listing : WEEKLY POSTING [ PART 2/3 ]
===================================================
Last Change : 17 April 1993


14. Plotting packages
=====================

Gnuplot 3.2
-----------
  It is one of the best 2- and 3-D plotting packages, with
  online help.It's a command-line driven interactive function plotting utility
  for UNIX, MSDOS, Amiga, Archimedes, and VMS platforms (at least!).
  Freely distributed, it supports many terminals, plotters, and printers
  and is easily extensible to include new devices.
  It was posted to comp.sources.misc in version 3.0, plus 2 patches.
  You can practically find it everywhere (use Archie to find a site near you!).
  The comp.graphics.gnuplot newsgroup is devoted to discussion of Gnuplot.

Xvgr and Xmgr (ACE/gr)
-----------------------
  Xmgr is an XY-plotting tool for UNIX workstations using
  X or OpenWindows. There is an XView version called xvgr for
  Suns. Collectively, these 2 tools are known as ACE/gr.
  Compiling xmgr requires the Motif toolkit version 1.1
  and X11R4 - xmgr will not compile under X11R3/Motif 1.0x.

  Check at ftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu [129.95.72.34} in
  /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xmgr-2.09.tar.Z (Motif version)
  /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xvgr-2.09.tar.Z (XView version)

  Comments, suggestions, bug reports to Paul J Turner
  <pturner@amb4.ese.ogi.edu> (if mail fails, try pturner@ese.ogi.edu).
  Due to time constraints, replies will be few and far between.

Robot
-----
  Release 0.45 : 2-D and limited 3-D. Based on XView 3, written
  in C / Fortran (so you need a Fortran compiler or the f2c translator).
  Mainly tested on Sun4, less on DECstations. Check at
  ftp.astro.psu.edu (128.118.147.28),  pub/astrod.

VG plotting library
-------------------
  This is a library of Fortran callable routines at sunspot.ceee.nist.gov
  [129.6.64.151]

Xgobi
-----
  It's being developed at Bellcore, and its speciality are
  multidimensional data sets analysis and exploration. You can call it
  from the S language also, and it works as an X11 client using the Athena
  widget set (or with an ASCII terminal). It's distributed free of charge
  from STATLIB at CMU.
  To get it via e-mail, send email to statlib@temper.stat.cmu.edu and
  in the body area of the message, put the line

  send xgobi from general

  If you want to pick it via ftp, connect to lib.stat.cmu.edu. Log in as
  ""statlib"" and use your e-mail address as your password. Then type

  cd general
  mget xgobi.*

  Warning: It's about 2 MB sources + large Postscript manual. Read the
  relevant README to decide whether you need it or not.

PGPLOT
------
  Runs on VAX/VMS and supposedly on UNIX. It's a set of fortran routines freely
  available (though copyrighted and requiring a nominal fee of $50 or so)
  that includes contour plots and support for various devices, including ps.
  Contact tjp@deimos.caltech.edu

+Athena Plotter Widget set
+-------------------------
+  
+  This version V6.0 is based on Gregory Bond's version V5-beta. Added
+  some stuff for scientific graphs, i.e. log axes, free scalable axes,
+  XY-lineplots and some more, and re-added plotter callbacks from V4, e.g.
+  to request the current pointer position, or to cut off a rectangle from the
+  plotting area for zooming-in. Version V6.0 has a log of bugs fixed and a
+  log of improvements against V6-beta. Additionally I did some other
+  changes/extensions, besides 
+

15. Image analysis software - Image processing and display
==========================================================

PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software)
======================

IMDISP
------
  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,
  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS
  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions
  [PC and Macs]

LabVIEW 2
---------
  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a
  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the
  ""program"" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.
  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a
  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the
  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and
  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any
  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real
  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual
  instrument.

  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)
  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time
  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for
  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The
  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block
  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming
  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:
  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters
  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C
  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual
  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.

  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an
  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level
  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level
  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.

  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has
  utility functions for memory management data communications and
  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for
  the development of custom code.)

Ultimage Concept VI
-------------------
  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual
  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end
  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.
  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory
  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,
  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,
  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.

  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further
  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of
  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and
  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical
  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and
  characterization.

  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel
  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and
  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can
  be imported.

  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial
  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic
  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological
  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole
  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.
  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and
  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of
  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and
  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The
  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom
  modules.

  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity
  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can
  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight
  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging
  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are
  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local
  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.
  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as
  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)
  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening
  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.

  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even
  hole filling.

  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,
  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.

IPLab Spectrum
--------------
  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the
  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by
  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user
  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far
  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool
  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a
  movie command for cycling through windows.


Macintosh-based tools
=====================

NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more
---------------------------------
  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the
  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results
  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,
  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from
  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been
  developed by Spyglass.

  zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32], directory:/pub/image.
  It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,
  tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting
  things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of
  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined
  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw
  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also
  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,
  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac
  that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version
  from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)

  analysis and scientific 2D and 3D plotting.""

  Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112

Adobe Photoshop
---------------

  The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey
  scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with
  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS
  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.
  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted
  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For
  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from
  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,
  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include
  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation
  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to
  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,
  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.

  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard
  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,
  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe
  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,
  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,
  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..

ColorStudio and ImageStudio
---------------------------
  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has
  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and
  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to
  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The
  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can
  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a
  variety of powerful selection tools including the ""auto selection tool""
  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close
  hues, color range and mask.

  global or feature parameters, and interpret the data.""

  Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283

Digital Darkroom
----------------
  The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and
  editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to
  select part of an image simply by ""painting"" it. A new polyline
  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide
  selections.  A brush lets the operator ""paint"" with a selected portion
  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.
  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale
  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as
  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.

Dimple
------
  It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or
  II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has
  the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image
  enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and
  unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There
  is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write
  your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however
  Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in
  the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching
  tool and it is very good for this purpose.""

  ""Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its
  development phase.. i.e. it doesn't have all the inbuilt features of
  other packages, but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt
  language for writing ""programs"" for processing an image, defining
  convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down
  menus etc... It is unprotected software.""

Enhance
-------
  Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally
  provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter
  variations: ""Laplacian, medium noise filter"", etc.  Files can be saved
  as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).

  MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109

Image Analyst
-------------
  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative
  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure
  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the
  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such
  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video
  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in
  radiographs.

  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video
  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of
  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine
  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature
  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst
  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or
  a disk-stored image.

  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user
  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.
  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically
  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.
  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and
  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and
  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR
  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.

  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence
  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user
  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)
  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the
  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,
  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and
  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so
  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also
  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

  Erdas.  I have used RSVGA with 6 of 7 Landsat bands and it is a good
  starter program except for the obtuse manual""

IMAGINE-32
----------
  It's a 32 bit package [I suppose for PCs] called ""Imagine32""
  or ""Image32"" The program does a modest amount of image processing --add,
  subtract, multiply, divide, display, and plot an x or y cut across the image.
  It can also display a number of images simultaneously.
  The company is CompuScope, in Santa Barbara, CA. 

PC Vista

  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything
  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.
  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based
  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware
  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and
  can do image arithmetic, etc.
    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is
  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and
  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.
     There is currently a project - ""AIPS++"" - underway to rewrite the
  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an
  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for
  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be
  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with
  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and
  Australia to name a few.

DISIMP
------
  (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful
  system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in
  interactive times.

  Feature Description

  DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and
  spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the
  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image
  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that
  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of
  modules.

  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and
  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and
  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and
  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and
  ratioing.

  Host Configuration Requirements

  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more
  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.
  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using
  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific
  applications programs.

  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick
  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,
  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be
  interactively driven through this control.

  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of
  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of
  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential
  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be
  added to further enhance referenced imagery.

  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels
  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help
  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The
  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional
  processing of remote sensed data.

Global Imaging Software
-----------------------
  ""We use Global Imaging Software to process AVHRR data, from the dish to
  the final display. Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,
  automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to
  byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically
  and carefree.

  It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn't that
  difficult to write your own with their programmer's module.

  Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for
  a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000
  with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display""

HIPS
----
(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)

  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image
  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image
  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil
  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of
  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has
  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well
  as a huge user-contributed library.

  Feature description

  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide
  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,
  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images
  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.

  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image
  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform
  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital
  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image
  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs
  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task
  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows
  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users
  become effective using HIPS on their first day.

  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in
  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been
  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines
  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and
  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX
  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual
  pages, and on-line documentation.

  Host Configuration Requirements

  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents
  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing
  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating
  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation
  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.
  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and
  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.
  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and
  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and
  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a
  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun
  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X
  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an
  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS
  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with
  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-
  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices
  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.

  Availability

  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an
  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It
  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS
  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or
  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of
  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

MIRA
----
[ Please DON'T confuse that with the Thalmanns animation system from
  Montreal. These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]

  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives
  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in
  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional
  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS
  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary
  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-
  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer
  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the
  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision
  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in
  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire
  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize
  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data
  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value
  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time
  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of
  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of
  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other 
  palettes can be generated.


Supported functions include such niceties as the following:

o  image & image: + - / * interpolation
o  image & constant: + - / *
o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,
   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.
o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or
   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.
o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,
   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp
   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,
   line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to
   any specified angle.
o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan
   bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to
   region target mean, median, or modal value.
o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,
   collapse 2-d image into 1-d image.
o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of
   region of an image.
o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot
   keyword values for a set of images.
o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,
   brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower
   luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive
   background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical
   aperture shape to image isophotes. 
o  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot
   of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`
   centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,
   change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and
   adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function
   or histogram equalization.
o  interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for
   registration.
o  interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or
   2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers
   can be cycled through. Interactive data analysis: polynomial fitting,
   point deletion, undelete, change value, point weighting, linear and
   quadratic loess and binomial smoothing, revert to unit point weights
   or original data buffer, substitute results into data buffer for pass
   back to calling function. Dump data buffer (+ overlays and error bars)
   to file or printer.  Change to user specified coordinate system.
o  Tricolor image combination and display, hardcopy halftone printout to
   HP-PCL compatible printers (Laserjet, deskjet, etc.)
o  Documentation is over 300 pages in custom vinyl binder.

They are news because they are the exceptions. And the 'Islamic Holocaust'
is much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during 
the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, 
assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people 
because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts 
of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes, 
set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts 
behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly 
attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population 
indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent 
Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with 
axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt
alive as can be seen below.

Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions 
of Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and 
Maras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion,
also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from 
behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of 
Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed 
widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena
was left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from 
Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide 
by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian, 
Russian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French 
journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century
committed by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads.

The Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum, 
Kars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their 
villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred.
The massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for
humanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German,
Austrian, French and American authorities.

Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and 
cruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by 
Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish 
and Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents. 
Even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of 
the victims of these cruelties can be heard.

""I have been closely following for two weeks the withdrawal of Russians and
 Armenians from Turkish territories through Armenia. Although two months
 have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I
 have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at 
 almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from
 Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly
 slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to
 save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful
 events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then
 taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people 
 well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these
 places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.
 They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the
 Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality
 problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers
 who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and
 Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the 
 Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs. 
 I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is 
 destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are 
 speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as 
 well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is 
 proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war.""

"There is a new product for the (IBM'ers) out there... it is called
IMAGINE and it just started shipping yesterday... I can personally attest that it will blow the doors off of 3D-Studio.  It is made by IMPUlSE, and is in its
3rd version....(1st) for the IBM.... it can do morphing, your standard key-framming animation, it is a raytracer (reflections & shadows), and can do/apply special FX to objects... (like ripple, explode, bounce) things of that nature.  Also it has algorithmic texture maps....and your standard brushmapping also...

you can have animated brushmaps...(ie. live video mapped on the objs)...
also animated backdrops (ie. live video backgrounds)
also animted reflections maps....

you get the idea.... it will run for about 500$ retail (I think)...

dont let the low price fool you.... this product can do it all when it
comes to 3D-animation and Renderering...!

I guess 100k, connecting pins 1-3 (1x), 1-6 (1y), 9-11 (2x), and 9-13 (2y).

Or: Get an 8-bit DA-Converter (merely a couple of transistors and
Resistors) and an OpAmp to compare its output to the voltage you want to
measure, connect them to a spared printer port (if you have one), and do
the rest by software (stepwise refinement). The port addresses for your
printer ports are probably: &H378 (LPT1), &H278 (LPT2). This should work
well enough for your purposes.

Authorities sometimes tell people to do evil things.  People who ""just
follow orders"" have tortured and killed others in very large numbers,
and protest their innocence afterwards.

When your authority starts telling you to do things, you should ask
questions.  Except for situations of pressing need (""I said shut the
hatch because the submarine is filling with water!""), any reasonable
authority should be able to give at least some justification that you
can understand.

Just be sure to listen when authority answers.

(If anybody is interested in questions of psychological pressure and
 following orders, you might want to read about a study done by Solomon Ashe
 in 1951 on conformity, and another done by Stanley Milgram in 1963 on
 obedience.  Both should be in any good book on psychology/sociology.  The
 results are both fascinating and terrifying.)

    Of course, nothing prevents you from buying a new lock with cash
and installing it yourself. Even modifying the core to match some
arbitrary key is not difficult to do at home. I once knew someone who
had fixed his locks in this way - his house, office and cars all took
the same key (which he took GOOD care of :-)



    Very bad (yours, that is). Have you ever had a safety deposit box?
They work on a two-key system. The bank clerk has one, and you have
the other (they are different keys). The bank does NOT keep a copy of
your key. If you lose it, they have to drill out the lock, and replace
the door. This is a time consuming and expensive process (which they
will be happy to charge to your account :-).

     This process is exactly analogous to having a private key which
is NOT in a escrow system, and the state having to crack your cipher
to get the data.

J.N. Darby was one of the founders of the ""Plymouth Brethren"" and an

"According to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking ""in X's
name"" is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today
would call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus' culture authorized
to conduct business ""in John's name"" had full authority over John's
financial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to
work only for John's benefit and consonant with John's wishes.  It was
not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with
""in John's name""; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney
and be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal
and religious definitions of ""faith"".)

With this cultural background, praying ""in Jesus' name"" does not
mandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the
petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous
""fiduciary"" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His
Kingdom.  The message of ""praying in Jesus' name"" is thus closely
aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God's
delegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and
responsibilities.  This idea of praying ""in Jesus' name"" is not only
present but prominent in the Lord's Prayer, although the verbal
forumula is absent.

The act of praying the words ""In Jesus' Name"" may be beneficial if
they cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the
advancement of God's Kingdom.  For that reason, I'm not quite ready
to say that the praying the formula is without meaning.

Prayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving,
etc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by
Christian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that's B.C.E. or
C.E. for you P.C. :-).  I don't see anything in Christ's words to
contradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His
omniscience and grace.

And has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root-
Bernstein.  See his book, ""Discovering"".  Ring structures for benzene
had been proposed before Kekule', after him, and at the same time as him.
The current models do not resemble Kekule's.  Many of the predecessors
of Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more.

I don't think ""extra-scientific"" is a very useful phrase in a discussion
of the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational
is a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases
of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.

For example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of
enantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a
friend's crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but
Pasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking
at the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he
lacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic
acid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.

Again, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers
(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because
he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks
contained fantasies of becoming the ""Newton of mirror-image life,"" which
he never admitted publically.

Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery
started this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile
and Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice.
Most of Griffiths' critics were French, which decided the issue for the
student.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro, which the
student eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the
research program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery
(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).",13

In fact Adiposity 101 mentions a similar study (search for ""life
events"" in any recent version of Adiposity 101).

The problem with anecdotal reports about individuals who have
lost weight and kept it off is that we don't know what caused
the weight gain in the first place.  This is critical because
someone who gains weight because of something temporary (drug
effect, life event, etc.) may appear successful at dieting when
the weight loss was really the result of reversing the temporary
condition that caused the weight gain.

For your information, Lankford is injured (I think it is his shoulder or rib
cage), so he could not use him as a pinch hitter.
 
I do believe that Whiten was a very good aquisition for the Cards.  He does
not have too much offensive capabilities, but he is an awesome defensively.
Since when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense?:)
I forgot who St. Louis gave up for him, but it was not too much.
 
As far as Gilkey is concerned, he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan, who
beat him out.  I expect to see a Gilkey/Jordan platoon in LF.
 
I agree with you on this one.  As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew that
Lankford was a dead bird.  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make
a perfect throw?
 
I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Don't
forget the overachieving Cards of '91 that won all those close games and went
from last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/
Twins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennant
race when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I
will never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are heading
in the right direction.
 
One more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds,
but with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in the

"I've had my Fluke 8060A here at work for just over 10 years now.
It is a wonderful meter.  Several colleagues here have some of the
newer Fluke meters, though I still would just as soon hang on to my
8060.  The 8060 a is the 1980s digial ""analog"" to the Simpson 260
analog DMM of the 1950-1960s.  There was/is (?) an 8060B that had
extended frequency response.

I've got a nifty little pen shaped meter made by Soar that I keep
in my toolbox at home.  I've had that for six or seven years now
and only replaced the batteries a couple of timees; it is more than
adequate for day-to-day hobby use.  I think Soar OEMs their stuff
for a number of vendors.  Some of JDR Microdevices' stuff looks
rather similar to Soar's.

Does USL SVR4 support LD_RUN_PATH a la Solaris 2?
Or an equivalent?

If so, you can put the library in a package specific lib directory,
compile the app with LD_RUN_PATH defined, and all should work.

Besides, I'd say name it libPACKAGExcl.a if possible.

One consideration to remember is that if you don't turn it off now,
you may not be able to later.  This isn't a case of reaching over and
flipping a switch; much of the spacecraft has to be working correctly
to execute a ""turn off"" command successfully.  Spacecraft do malfunction
in their old age.  The big concern is not radio clutter from idle
spacecraft, but radio clutter from malfunctioning spacecraft that can
no longer be turned off.",14

  Minor quibble:  The assualt (and it was one) began near dawn.  The fire did
not break out for several hours.  I find it highly unlikely that the BD would
be cooking lunch while armored vehicles punch holes in their house and are
pumping in tear gas.  The lantern story makes more sense, except the fire 
seemed to spread too quickly, even given the nature of the buildings and the
very high winds.  And it was daylight, but I guess in the innner recesses it
could be dark--shutters probably closed as well.

  Which puts us back to the FBI did it, or the BD did it, or some other screw-
up occured, which is quite possible.

  The problem with the FBI as a monolithic entity doing it is that it requires
*everybody* involved to keep their mouths shut.  While they tended to behave 
like total idiots, that does not make them homocidal maniacs, either.  And if
it was one nutcase agent, then it serves no purpose to blame the whole agency.

  I can believe that a real nut-case like a Koresh would start such a fire,
but I'm far from convinced he actually did so.

  Then again, I rarely go off making blanket condemnations and pronouncments
within 2 hours of a very confusing incident over 175 miles away...

It's all easy with a DSP. The Olivetti Quaderno, for example [*great* 1kg
subnotebook/palmtop PC -- sorry for the plug, folks, but Olivetti don't
seem to be doing a good job marketing it themselves :-)] includes sound
digitisation hardware; they provide vocoders for their DSP which produce
varous bit-rates. There's one which gives pretty acceptable voice
quality at 13Kbit/sec, just right for a V.32bis modem.

Their DSP can play and record at the same time, too -- so you wouldn't
need to play ""two-way-radio"". You can also download code to the DSP
subunit, though you'd need a software development kit for the DSP in 
question [dunno which it is...] if you wanted to produce your own 
vocoder for, say, V.32 speeds.

"I have been convinced of the right of AMericans to an effective 
self-defense, but something strikes me as odd among the
pro-RKBA arguments presented here.

The numbers comparing hundreds of thousands (indeed, even a
million) of instances of law abiding citizens deterring
criminal activity, seem valid to me.  Likewise the number
of gun-caused homicides each year (about 11,000/year?).  However,
it is surprising that the ""Evil AntiGun Empire "" (Darth Vader
breathing sound effect here) never tries to compare
""All legitimate gun defenses"" vs. ""All gun crimes.""  Instead, 
it's always ""All legitimate gun defenses,""  which includes
cases in which the criminals are shot but not killed, and
cases in which the criminal is not here, vs. just 
criminal gun homicides, which only includes case sin which
the victim died.

Why is this?  Of course, it wouldn't be unreasonable to say
that in each crime already measured (involving guns), the
consequnces are already known and it is safe to assume that
a gun-based bank robbery last week will not suddenly turn
into a gun-basd robbery+homicide.  Whereas in the legitimate
gun defenses, one may assume that all those criminals who
were deterred would have committed more crime or more
serious crimes had they not been deterred.

So its an automatic? Don't know if US spec=CDN spec. for Maximas.


If it is the first set of brake pads on front, then this is fine. My car
eats a set every 15k miles or so. The fact that he is replacing the
muffler too is also ok.


The mileage is fairly low - but typical fwd stuff is CV joints. Check
the maintenance records with the manufacturers requirements for valve
adjustments, timing belt changes and so on.

The 60k mile service is often expensive, so make sure he has done everything.


Well, this is one of the commonly cited methods for identifying a
car with highway miles. 
Might check the gas pedal wear too. Ask him how many sets of tires he
has been through. A highway car might have squeezed by on 2 sets,
a hard driven car 6-10 sets.



Well, the Maxima should be pretty reliable - but if its out of warranty
you should get it checked out by someone knowledgeable first. Stuff
for Japanese cars can be expensive.

DEPOSITION OF ZAVEN ARMENAKOVICH BADASIAN

   Born 1942
   Employed
   Sumgait Bulk Yarn Plant

   Resident at Building 34, Apartment 33
   Microdistrict No. 12
   Sumgait [Azerbaijan]


On February 27 my wife and I went to Baku to go shopping and returned to 
Sumgait at around five in the evening. We ran into one of my relatives at the 
bus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away,
near the store. Well at first we didn't know what was happening, and then a
fellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, ""What are you
standing here for? Go home immediately!"" I asked, ""What's going on?"" He says, 
""What's the matter, can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're 
killing Armenians!"" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.

We sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our 
courtyard. But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building. There were 
about 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They
were shouting something, but you couldn't understand it. It wasn't one voice 
or two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35.
They went up to the third _floor, and we see that they're breaking glass and 
throwing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one 
has a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a 
guitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.

We had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School 
No. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families 
there with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only 
known Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani 
guard at the school let us in. At first he didn't want to, but there was 
nowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We 
were told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our 
microdistrict.

We went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.

On the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be
used to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of 
them and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I
asked him for assistance. I say, ""We're in School No. 33, we need to be 
evacuated."" Well he says, ""Got it, wait there, I'm sending out help now.""

I know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with
him personally. When I called he said, ""Muslimzade here.""

About two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out
the window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, ""Armenians, come 
out, we're here to get you."" They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in 
their hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, ""Where should I go?"" I 
say, ""If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that 
the Armenians were here and that they left."" That's what he did. He went down 
there and said, ""The Armenians were here,"" he said, ""I let them out the back 
door, they went that way."" And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and 
noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.

So the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right!
Instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that
Muslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that 
we were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the 
morning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.

In the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers 
took us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there 
were lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy, 
about three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn't a single doctor, 
nothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was
just very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything
they could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his 
mother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...

I searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I
wanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third
floor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping, 
with their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of 
them.

There were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten, 
everyone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City
Party Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage 
was 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being
sold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to 
get the things any cheaper.

I met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in
his eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we 
worked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw 
me and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. You can understand his 
feelings, of course.

"Am I justified in being pissed off at this doctor?

Last Saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knife.
I took him to a local ""Urgent and General Care"" clinic at 5:50 pm.  The 
clinic was open till 6:00 pm.  The receptionist went to the back and told the 
doctor that we were there, and came back and told us the doctor would not 
see us because she had someplace to go at 6:00 and did not want to be delayed 
here.  During the next few minutes, in response to my questions, with several 
trips to the back room, the receptionist told me:
	- the doctor was doing paperwork in the back,
	- the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going
	  to the emergency room;
	- the doctor would not even speak to me;
	- she would not tell me the doctor's name, or her own name;
	- when asked who is in charge of the clinic, she said ""I don't know.""

I realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room, but
I was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want to
be bothered.  My son did get three stitches at the emergency room.  I'm still 
trying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so I can write them a 
letter.   We will certainly never set foot in that clinic again.

"Re: Space billboards

Even easier to implement than writing messages on the Moon, once upon
a time a group of space activists I belonged to in Seattle considered
a ""Goodyear Blimp in orbit"".  The idea was to use a large structure
that could carry an array of lights like the Goodyear Blimp has.
Placed in a low Earth orbit of high inclination, it could eventually
be seen by almost everyone on Earth.  Only our collective disapproval
of cluttering up space with such a thing stopped us from pursuing
it.  It had quite feasible economics, which I will not post here
because I don't want to encourage the idea (if you want to do such
a thing, go figure it out for yourself).

By '8 grey level images' you mean 8 items of 1bit images?
It does work(!), but it doesn't work if you have more than 1bit

With 2 bit per pixel; there could be 1*c_1 + 4*c_2 timing,
this gives 16 levels, but they are linear if screen intensity is
linear.
With 1*c_1 + 2*c_2 it works, but we have to find the best

I hate to pour cold water on this, but currently seawater extracted
uranium, even using the new, improved fiber absorbers from Japan, is
about 20 times more expensive than uranium on the spot market.
Uranium is *very* cheap right now, around $10/lb.  Right now, there
are mines closing because they can't compete with places like Cigar
Lake in Canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards
to the mines, who work in shielded vehicles).  Plenty of other sources
(for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before
uranium reached $200/lb.

""Demand and supply balance will collapse"" is nonsense.  Supply and
demand always balance; what changes is the price.  Is uranium going
to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century?
Not bloody likely.  New nuclear reactors are not being built
at a sufficient rate.

Uranium from seawater is interesting, but it's a long term project, or
a project that the Japanese might justify on grounds of
self-sufficiency.",14

Let's say that Israel grants the PLO _EVERYTHING THEY EVER ASKED FOR_.
That Israel goes back to the 1967 borders.  What will the ""Palestinean
Arabs"" in Tel-Aviv call themselves?  The Palestineans in West
Jerusalem?  In Haifa?  Will they still claim to be ""occupied""?

Or do you suggest that Israel expell or kill off any remaining Arabs,

       As perhaps some insight into how this sort of thing works, the
local college newspaper had a big crusade to have the U.T. police
release crime stats.  (The school claimed that to do so would violate
federal education records privacy laws).  They swore up and down they
weren't interested in student discipline records, only for stats so people
could make an evaluation of how safe the campus was.

       It was barely a week after crime stats were released before the
Daily Beacon had an editorial calling for student disciplinary stats
to be released, because they complained certain segments of the campus
population were treated administratively rather than turned over to the
police and therefore the criminal states weren't accurate.

       What people say they want public today may not be what they
say tomorrow.

[stuff deleted for brevity]


Your very starting point is wrong.  Christianity is not based on following
a moral standard.  ""For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith...
NOT BY WORKS so that no man may boast.""  (Eph. 2:7-8)  You say that
you know the Bible well, and can recognize (do you mean recite?) many
passages from memory.  That could very well be so.  However, it looks like
there are a few more passages that you should pay attention to.  (Titus 3:5
and James 2:10 are among them.)

Obedience to the moral law is imporant.  However, it is supposed to be the
result of turning your life over to Christ and becoming a Christian.  It is
by no means the starting point.

"I am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway.

 About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes
 under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement
 of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of
 the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced
 the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor 
 suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.

 While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being 
 manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently
 increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (
 palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part
 the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had
 been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the
 pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is 
 persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3
 and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides
 minor reductions in pain and is only short term.  

 My questions are: 

     Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the
     levels of pain?

     Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?

     Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?


  Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.
  
  
  Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.

SPACE ACTIVIST/INTEREST/RESEARCH GROUPS AND SPACE PUBLICATIONS

    GROUPS

    AIA -- Aerospace Industry Association. Professional group, with primary
	membership of major aerospace firms. Headquartered in the DC area.
	Acts as the ""voice of the aerospace industry"" -- and it's opinions
	are usually backed up by reams of analyses and the reputations of
	the firms in AIA.

	    [address needed]

    AIAA -- American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
	Professional association, with somewhere about 30,000-40,000
	members. 65 local chapters around the country -- largest chapters
	are DC area (3000 members), LA (2100 members), San Francisco (2000
	members), Seattle/NW (1500), Houston (1200) and Orange County
	(1200), plus student chapters. Not a union, but acts to represent
	aviation and space professionals (engineers, managers, financial
	types) nationwide. Holds over 30 conferences a year on space and
	aviation topics publishes technical Journals (Aerospace Journal,

	and is _THE_ source on current aerospace state of the art through
	their published papers and proceedings. Also offers continuing
	education classes on aerospace design. Has over 60 technical
	committees, and over 30 committees for industry standards. AIAA acts
	as a professional society -- offers a centralized resume/jobs
	function, provides classes on job search, offers low-cost health and
	life insurance, and lobbies for appropriate legislation (AIAA was
	one of the major organizations pushing for IRAs - Individual
	Retirement Accounts). Very active public policy arm -- works
	directly with the media, congress and government agencies as a
	legislative liaison and clearinghouse for inquiries about aerospace
	technology technical issues. Reasonably non-partisan, in that they
	represent the industry as a whole, and not a single company,
	organization, or viewpoint.

"I am having trouble with SCSI on a Mac IIfx. The machine is 3 years old
and I have been using the same hard drive (internal Maxtor LXT-200S) for
two and a half years. The disk recently crashed. I reformatted (Silverlining
5.42), but during the reformat I received random write errors during testing.
The error message reported was like:

Sector 0: Write error detected after testing good - sector not mapped out.

This occurred randomly all over the hard disk (which makes me suspect the
diagnostic's reference to Sector 0 ??? ). On the third reformat and after
reinstalling the SCSI read/write loops I was able to get through passes
2,3, and 4 with no errors. (Pass 1 for some reason reported a lot of errors,
but still mapped out no sectors.) I decided to go ahead and try to resinstall
System 7 and reload my data from a backup. This proceded normally; however,
I now have sub-optimal performance. Symptoms include:

   o Frequent crashes
   o Instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to
       correct.
   o Instances of not finding the disk on the SCSI chain on reboot.
       - If I boot from Norton Utl. after this occurs, it cannot find the
         disk either.
       - The only thing that fixes this is recycling the power. It sometimes
         requires several attempts.

QUESTIONS:

   1) Has anyone had this type of problem before?
   2) Is the problem with the fx motherboard (And its non-standard
      SCSI implementation) or with my Maxtor Disk? Is there some
      diagnostic software that would help me make this determination?
   3) Is it a termination problem? I currently have external Syquest
      and an external DataFrame XP60 on the chain. The XP60 is at the
      end, and has internal termination; so I am not using the IIfx
      terminator. I do have the SCSI filter installed on the internal
      drive. I have run with this exact steup for 2 1/2 years with
      one previous disk crash requiring a reformat (about a year ago).
      I also have symptoms if I disconnect the external devices;
      so I don't see how SCSI termination would now be an issue. Of
      course who knows :-<

Help would be much appreciated.",4

The problem if  transffering US government files about Yigal Arens
and some other similar persons does or does not violate a federal
or a local American law seemed to belong to some local american law
forum  not to this forum.
The readers of this forum seemed to be more interested in the contents
of those files.
So It will be nice if Yigal will tell us:
1. Why do American authorities consider Yigal Arens to be dangerous?
2. Why does the ADL have an interest in that person ?
3. If one does trust either the US government or the ADL what an
   additional information should he send them ?

 	II. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because
 		they are not quoted by the NT authors.

That is not quite accurate.  Otherwise we would have the book
of Enoch in the canon (as Dave noted).  One can say that the 
apocrypha are not quoted by Christ.  


III. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because
 		they teach doctrines contrary to the (uncontroverted)
 		parts of the canon.
 
 	then I answer: 
 		These is a logically invalid *a priori*. 
 		Besides, we are talking about OT texts- 
 		which in many parts are superceded by the NT
 		(in the Xtian view). Would not this same
 		principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_?
 		This principle cannot be consistently applied.
 
I have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with one
voice, and he does not contradict himself.  

The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired
by the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is more
guided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decided
that the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some books
such as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example,
the Lutheran hymn ""Now Thank We All Our God"" quotes a passage
from this book.

The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church's
history.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the
rest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added these
books was guided by the Spirit in so doing.  And that is where
this sort of discussion ultimately ends.",15
"I just hooked up my Mac IIsi to a relatively old (1 year?) Asante EN/SC
adapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the
newest drivers from Asante's ftp server.

The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain -
specifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac
tests memory, etc. Just before the ""happy Mac face"" normally shows up, the
power light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use
the network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the
Asante box pretty much unusable.

It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn
on the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed
during the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter
works, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has
*never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had
it for over a year).

Here is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk --
several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the
head or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator
(both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal
resistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another
identical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.

Has anybody seen this? More importantly, does anyone have a solution?
Thanks a lot.    E.

"We here at Utah State University Cooperative Extension have been using
W4Wg for a while now.  We wanted to talk to the internet with the mail
package so we got the smtp gateway.  You also need a tcp/ip transport
package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that's what they
require to get the smtp gateway to work.  You need a dedicated pc
for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another
dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff.  We do not have the remote mail
going but you indicate that that is what you want to do.  

There is a glitch somewhere in the system though.  I don't know if it
is MS mail, the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in the
mail that is sent.  The scenario is this.  The outgoing mail goes to a
Unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go.  If that mail
is routed to the VAX, the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail.
Most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail
on the VAX forwarded to some other location.  That is the main gotcha.
Where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header
then a message saying ""Boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)"".  If you
can stay away from sending to a VAX you are ok.  The system people
of course say that the VAX is not the problem, the gateway is probably
the problem.  If anyone wants to get help it is only $175.00 for one
support call. (until problem is worked out)  Phooey to that I say.  I
am looking vigorously for a better Idea.  

If you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew,  please
drop me a note - anyone.  The next itteration is supposed to have tcp/ip
built in THEY say........  The netxt itteration of w4wg

this (or any way for that matter) let me know.  I cannot (or I don't think)
call the XtNgetValue callback myself because I don't have the value for
the third parameter of the get value proc (XtPointer call_data).

You seem to be saying that a LIMITED government will provide MORE
opportunities for private interests to use it to pursue their own
agendas, and asking libertarians to prove that this will NOT happen.
While I can't offer such a proof, it seems pretty damn plausible that
if the government does not regulate a particular area, it cannot become
a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area.
I rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have NOW that is
more likely to become such a tool, and that it IS such a tool in many
instances.


I suspect that this is because ""improvement in the human condition"" as
you define it is not the primary goal of libertarianism, and would not
be the primary goal of a libertarian government.  My impression of
libertarianism is that its primary goal is the elimination of
government coercion except in a very limited cases.

Definitions:

z = the tilt of the axis of the planet away from the normal to its
orbital plane.  In case of the Earth z is about 23.5 degrees, I think.
I do not recall the exact value.  In case of Uranus, z is almost
90 degrees.

u = latitude of the location where the length of the day is measured.
Paris is at about 45 degrees.  North pole is at 90.

a = angular position of the planet around the sun.  As a goes from
0 to 360 degrees, the planet makes a full circle around the sun.
The spring equinox occurs at a=0.

L = daylight fraction = (duration of daylight)/(duration of a full day).
On the equator (u=0) L is always 1/2.  Near the north pole (u=90 degrees)
L is sometimes one and sometimes zero, depending on the time of the year.

Computation:
Define the auxiliary angles p and q by:
sin p = sin a sin z
cos q = h ( tan u tan p ),       (0 < q < 180 degrees)

Conclusion:
L = q / 180   (if q is measured in degrees)
L = q / pi    (if q is measured in radians)

Wait!  But what is h?
The cutoff function h is defined as follows:

h (s) = s    if  |s| < 1
      = 1    if   s > 1
      = -1   if   s < 1

As an interesting exercise, plot L versus a.   The graph will shows
how the length of the daylight varies with the time of the year.
Experiment with various choices of latitudes and tilt angles.
Compare the behavior of the function at locations above and below
the arctic circle.

All true.  And all good points.



Well, making a career out of it is a bit strong.  I still believe
that doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I would
not have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent
the many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done.
And 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that 
would help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank
goodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine
that helps me.  

I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That you
would go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second
opinion, and then move on with your life.
Just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in 
this field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses.
These are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over
the country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going
to a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was 
helpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very
unproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research,
make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.

A recent movie, Lorenzo's Oil, offers a perfect example of what
I'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's not
a put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors are
only human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us
out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing
piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.

I guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things
that is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart,
or failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That's because 
those things are much more tangible and have much more concise 
definitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have to
decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to
find your way out of it.


I have chosen the latter.

"

Actually I don't think there is any conflict if we really understand
what these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the 
meaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will
come to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere 
belief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your 
belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this 
is what James means when he says that ""faith without works is dead"" 
and, ""I will show you my faith by my works.""  Remember James was 
writing to ""the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.""  This 
probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much 
later and wouldn't understand the meaning of the original Greek.
(Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he
intended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the
people of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of
the Greek.

Another key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul's
statements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul
contrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the
gospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great
burden of Paul's life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go
convert a bunch of people, then the ""Judizers"" would come along and
try to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf
Acts chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being
saved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood
of Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation
for today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think
""faithfulness"" today has a meaning closer to what the original
writers intended.


I think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is
that God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not ""keep kosher"" to a
kosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters
of following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.


In the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and 
be lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are 
worse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in
the parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in
the one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that
the price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.

[I agree with you in general, including the fact that ""pistis"" has
some of the force of ""faithful"".  However if you take that too far,
you can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have
intended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say
that we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we
are saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that's not what you meant.

I have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that
completely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I'd
call a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and
commitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic
change.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show
the new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any
Christian there had better be the basic change in orientation that
Jesus calls being born again.",15

If you recall, a subject was raised some weeks ago that touched upon
this.  When someone claimed that guerillas were manifestations of

his own free will, aiding them, has he violated his ""civilian"" status?


But don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways?
If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word
of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the
Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  Afterall,
Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas
it occupied in Lebanon during SLG.


That is not exactly true.  The Hizbollah and their affiliated groups
have made several attempts to infiltrate the border of Israel.


True, but the Syrians did allow (until at least 1984) guerillas to operate
in the areas that were under their control, provided that those guerillas

If you don't already know it, you should call the bank/credit union/
finance company that holds the loan on your present car and get the
current payoff cost.

If you are trading in your current car on the new car, subtract the
payoff amount from the trade-in the dealer is giving you.  (If this
turns out to be a negative number, you need to reconsider the deal.)
Subtract this difference from the price of the new car.  This is the
size of the loan you will need for the new car.

The dealer will take care of paying off the loan on your old car out
of the money you give them when you pick up your new car.

At least that's how it worked for me 5 years ago in Ohio...

"I'm attempting to write a serious policy paper examining whether the
proposed wiretap (or ""Clipper"") chip is a cost-effective tool for
police investigation.  That is, ignoring concerns about government
intrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps to
investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry,
and their customers, to support this wiretap technology?  

A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million
dollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  (In 1990, 872 U.S.
wiretaps led to 2057 arrests, while total police expenditures of $28
billion led to 11.25 million arrests [ref US Statistical Abstracts].)
I'm working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately, but
I'd like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating
the costs of the new proposed wiretap technology.

Please send me quotable/citeable estimates for:

- How many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all
  phones with wiretap chips?
- How much would it cost to make each chip?
- How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place?
- How much more would supporting hardware, people, etc. cost, per chip?
- What percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been
  if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs?
- What percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed
  ""law enforcement blocks""?
- What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year?

Put another way, the question I'm asking is, what if each police
agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it, being
charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication
to be wiretap compatible?  Would they choose to buy such wiretaps, or
would they find it more cost-effective to instead investigate crimes
in other ways?",11

"Here is a press release from the Natural Resources Defense Council.

 New Data Show About 100 Major U.S. Water Supplies Vulnerable To
Milwaukee-Type Disease Outbreak
 To: National Desk, Environment Writer
 Contact: Erik Olson or Sarah Silver, 202-783-7800, both
          of the Natural Resources Defense Council

   WASHINGTON, April 14  -- Internal EPA data released
today by the Natural Resources Defense Council reveals that about
100 large water systems -- serving cities from Boston to San
Francisco -- do not filter to remove disease-carrying organisms
leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease
outbreak similar to the one affecting Milwaukee.
   The EPA list is attached.
   ""These internal EPA documents reveal that the safety of water
supplies in many American cities is threatened by inadequate
pollution controls or filtration,"" said Erik Olson, a senior
attorney with NRDC.  ""Water contamination isn't just a problem in
Bangladesh, it's also a problem in Bozeman and Boston.""
   ""As of June 29, 1993, about 100 large surface water systems on
EPA's list probably will be breaking the law.  The 1986 Safe
Drinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to either
filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use
from pollution,"" Olson continued.  Some systems are moving
towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are
expected to miss the law's deadline.
   Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already
a reality in other cities.  A 1991 survey of 66 U.S. surface
water systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent
of raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organism
cryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasite
called giardia.
   Adding to the level of concern, a General Accounting Office
study released today by House Health and Environment Subcommittee
Chairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the
nation's system for conducting and following through on sanitary
surveys of water systems.
   ""This new information raises a huge warning sign that millions
of Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be
assured that their water is safe to drink.  We must immediately
put into place programs to protect water sources from
contamination and where this is not assured, filtration equipment
must be installed to protect the public,"" Olson noted.  ""The time
has come for many of the nation's water utilities to stop
dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from
contamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs
needed to assure their water is safe to drink.""
   NRDC is a national non-profit environmental advocacy organization.

It could be one of the leukodystrophies (not adrenal, only
boys get that).  Surely you've been to a university pediatric
neurology department.  If not that is the next step.  Biopsies
might help, especially if peripheral nerves are also affected.
There are so many of these diseases that would fit the symptoms
you gave that more can't be said at this time.

I agree with your surmise that it is an autosomal recessive.
If so, your normal children won't have to worry too much unless
they marry near relatives.  Most recessive genes are rare
except in inbred communities (e.g. Lithuanian Jews).

	Oh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, had
negligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,
now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent
hitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,
he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't 
know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are
similar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field,
he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his
OBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)
was a absolute-primo-dick.  
	Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that
MVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the
MVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.  
	Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s
solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks 
(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been 
a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  
	You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,
simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you 
blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)
Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, 
the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should 
HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.
	Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like
Ted Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.


	Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?


	Now, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the
position of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along
the lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a 
good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more
recent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early
80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's
offense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his
career, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer
:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.
	Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real
stiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,
and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as
SS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.


	Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a ""mediot"" 
candidate, pushed because of his ""winning attitude"" (a minor factor, if one
at all), and his ""great defense"" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of
a tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.
	SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last
year or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk
about Morris' ""ability to win"" which is nothing more than Morris' ""ability
to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs"".  At this point, Morris is an
average pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned 
close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the
80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year
for Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but
not favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF
""consideration"".  
	Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will
throw back your earlier logic about ""Yount and Smith being shortstops who 
hung around a long time"".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's 
just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...
(Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)
	Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few
more years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most
likely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much
regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY 
tragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and
legitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the
league.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the
end, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.

	This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it 
or not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off
the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably
left a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.  I won't consider ANYONE
who started playing after about 1985 (again, too early to tell.) [Note: these
are all active players, I'm not counting recent retirees]

Baltimore:  Cal Ripken (should be a lock by now, even if Gehrig's record stands)
Boston: Roger Clemens (might be a lock already, which is amazing), Dawson (?)
Detroit: Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker (possibilities)
Milwaukee: Robin Yount (discussed earlier)
New York: Wade Boggs (possibly), Mattingly (long shot)
Toronto: Paul Molitor and Jack Morris (possibilities)

Kansas City: George Brett (lock)
Minnesota: Kirby (too early to tell), Winfield (lock)
Oakland: Eckersley (lock), McGwire (too early), Rickey (lock), Welch (LONG shot)
Texas: The Mighty Nolan [Too early to consider Canseco or Strange :-)]

Cubs: Sandberg (lock)
St. Louis: Ozzie (lock), Lee Smith (probably)
New York: Murray (almost a lock), Saberhagen (obviously, he's got to regain
				  	      past form)
[And most certainly, NOT Vince Coleman, despite what he'll tell you :-)]

Los Angeles: Butler, Strawberry, and Hershiser are all long shots.
San Diego: Tony Gwynn (pretty good shot)
Colorado: Dale Murphy (a good shot), Ryan Bowen (just to see if you're awake)

	[Before I get flames: this is an off-the-top-of-the-head list, there's
probably a few deserving candidates that I left off, and, I didn't include
Barry Bonds, Will Clark, Any Atlanta Starting Pitcher, Frank Thomas, Canseco,
McGriff, etc. because I only considered guys who started playing before
1985)]

You know, in many ways this might be just the kick we need to straighten
things out in this country.  Also, people would have a need to replace
guns with something else, perhaps deadly sprays that would make Mace and OC
seem like water.  They would be lighter and easier to conceal.

Guns are really ""old"" in design and as long as we have tons of them, no one
is motivated to design something better.  I'm sure we could come up with
some real nasty stuff if we tried and getting rid of these guns would get
us moving on this track asap.  This is what we really want, right?  Stuff
that's smaller, lighter and far more deadly.",16

"For those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to think
about airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from 
Dennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated
at 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to
the relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay
pins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used
a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.
	I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front
fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube
frame used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to
do this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two
vertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing
follows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.
The compressor is about 2"" in diameter and about 5"" long.
	The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small
so there should be plenty of good places for it.
	I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to
mount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side
just in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the
horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where
the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough
room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice
cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.
	The short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out
about an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look
closely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight
ahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).
	If you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try
to explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them
first.
	How do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound
more like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.
I have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has
not blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).
	I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though
they know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping
the pedestrians on the sidewalk.
The bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to
those stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)
and are relatively easy to install on the FJ. YMMV.",8

Tommy Frandsen's VGAlib (which is probably what you're talking about)
will do the standard VGA modes, some tweaked modes and then the Tseng
ET4000 Super VGA modes. I have an ET4000 and I'm viewing GIF's at
640x480/256 (I have a lousy/small monitor) with dpg-view on Linux. I
think I had to change some constants in the dpg-view sources to make it
use the ET4k modes.

VGAlib's sources seem to be designed for easy addition of new Super VGA
support; each mode is an array of register values and there's a program
that dumps an array declaration of this kind describing the current
mode. Haven't tried it though...

One interpretation I've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin 
of physically abusing one's wife.  The husband is usually physically 
stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.  
He must honor her as his sister in Christ.  This would therefore be an 
example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.

This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what 
is God's will for his family without consulting his wife.  God reveals 
His will to both the husband and the wife.  There needs to be some 
degree of mutuality in decision making.  Even those whose understanding 
of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the 
husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.  
One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband 
and to the husband through the wife.

you can switch the polarities) Israeli newspapers will get either
a -9 or -10, American leading  newspapers and TV news range from -6
to -10 (yes there are some that are more Israelis than Israelis)
The Montreal suburban (a local free newspaper) probably is closer
to Kahane's views than some Israeli right wing newspapers, British
range from 0 (neutral) to -10, French (that Iknow of, of course) range
from +2 (Afro-french magazines) to -10, Arab official media range from
0 to -5 (Egyptian)  to +9 in SA. Why no +10? Because they do not want to
overdo it and stir people against Israel and therefore against them since 
they are doing nothing.

I think Orthodox practice varies from place to place, from parish to parish and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In some parishes here in South Africa the only ones who receive communion are infants (i.e. children under
 7). In our parish it is expected that one will have been to Vespers and confessional prayers the evening before, and that one will have been fasting. As we have to travel 70km to the church, we don'

RKBA archive: general information and anonymous ftp instructions.

The moderator of the firearms-politics mailing list, Karl Kleinpaste,
has agreed to set up an anonymous ftp archive directory for RKBA
related information.  This directory can be used for things like
articles by Kates, Wright, Tonso, Levinson, Supreme Court Decisions,
the RIA vs US decision, copies of legislation, and so on.  It's not
meant to be for the discussions that normally appear here.

So, in the future if you're looking for something check there first
and then ask here.

Instructions:

Short version for techies:

The site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu.  Place contributions into the
directory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba.  The ftp commands
get, put, mget, or mput should work.  Give the command ""type binary""
to be sure files are transferred correctly.  Your files will be moved
to the rkba directory.  To get a file use the commands get or mget.

I will maintain an index which you should get first to check if
the file you want to read or write already is archived.

Long version for non-techies:

In order for you to use this archive your computer must be on
the Internet.  To connect to the archive site run the command:

	ftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu

If that doesn't work you cannot use this archive.  If the ftp
command is successful you'll get this prompt asking you for a
login:
	Name (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc):

Instead of lvc your initials will appear.  Answer this prompt with:

	ftp

Next you'll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address:

	Guest login ok, send e-mail address as password:

I would enter:

	l.v.cipriani@att.com

You'll enter your own e-mail address.  You'll get these lines
or similar as output:

	Remote system is UNIX.
	Using binary mode to transfer files.

Next, the command prompt is printed:

	ftp> 

If you do not get the line ""Using binary mode to transfer files.""
Run the command:

	type binary

Now you're logged in to the archive machine.  There are many
directories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are

	/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba
and
	/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming

There are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below.

When you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon.  To retreive
files change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command:

	cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba
or
	cd pub/firearms/politics/rkba

To submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with
the command:

	cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming
or
	cd pub/firearms/politics/incoming

Once you do this you'll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enter
another command.

To find the names of the existing files in the directory you are
in run the command:

	ls -l

This will produce something like:

... and so on ...

Each line corresponds to one file.  Reading right to left, the fields
are the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of
the file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need
to be concerned with.

To get a file run the command ""get"" followed by the name of the file
you want, for example:

	get INDEX
or
	get noduty

After the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:

	Transfer complete.
	19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s)

You can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive.
You can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If the
file you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/HR1025
you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first
and then retrieve it:

	cd congress/103rd
	get HR1025

Once you're finished you can log off with the command:

	quit

If you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little
different.  First of all you should find out if the file already
exists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above
and look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an entry.  The
index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba
directory.  For example:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
File: whitemanslaw

White Man's Law by William R. Tonso, from the December 1985
Reason magazine
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry, login
and change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Once
you are in the incoming directory use the command:

	put file_name

In this case:

	put whitemanslaw

Again there'll be a ""Transfer complete, so many bytes transfered
in so many seconds"" message.  Now your file is on the archive
machine.

Another thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be sure
there isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same
as the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you'll
overwrite the previous file [or you'll get an error message].

Your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a
file by the same name in the rkba directory.

Once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for
the INDEX file and I will add it to the file.

If you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute
a file email the file to me and I'll take care of the rest.

If you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, so
be sure to let me know first.

If you have any questions feel free to ask me.

"Hello--

I just bought a new portable CD player for the office, and I notice that
it proudly proclaims ""8 TIMES OVERSAMPLING"" on the box.  Now while I think
I understand what oversampling is (the rate of discrete ""samples""
exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor),
I don't understand this ""8 TIMES"" business...  It seems to me that when
I bought my first CD player (was it REALLY 10 years ago?!), the specs
said ""4 TIMES"" ...  Could someone please tell me whether I'm getting
senile?  If I'm not, then what good does it do for the player to take
samples at a higher rate?  If I really wanted better fidelity, wouldn't
I have to have the same higher rate of sampling during the recording
process?  Furthermore, am I wrong in interpreting the sampling rate
(from the player's point of view) as being the same thing as the data
rate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium?  Does this mean
that the data rate (related to the rotational speed of the disk) has 
changed since 1983?

I'm so confused...

"After reading the debate over the Clipper, I have a few things to
add.

	First, most of the people I know who activly use encryption
privately do not care about most of the issues that surround this debate,
and any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the US. All they
care about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That,
after all IS the bottom line. 

	Second, if I look at all the people I know who use any form
of encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons who
still insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people 
looking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not think
of anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves
their methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this, because people make
mistakes by nature, and the US government is made up of people who are
just as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else. 

	Third, since most of the people I know are at least marginaly
familiar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption
stratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that
someone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip.
That despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can 
not see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.

	Fourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure there are many stupid
people out there. And yes, some will be open to being caught via the 
built in back door of the Clipper Chip. However, anyone who is going to
do any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going
to run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I would assume, start
looking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. 


	If nothing else were avalible, none of this would be an issue. However,
the truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into
simply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything
else. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I do
not think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be
slowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to 
convert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything,
the Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.


	The bottom line here is that people will use what works, and
unavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption
related charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty
charges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy.
	The other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide 
useage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is
out of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Box
has been opened), and this is not going to change. I've seen a blindness
to this that I've found utterly stunning, and the Clipper Chip, along
with the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger
degree.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code
  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with
  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,
  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,
  etc.  The terms ""Xt"" and ""Intrinsics"" are used interchangeably,
  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X
  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,
  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the
  Intrinsics are not especially useful.

o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The
  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It
  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the
  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless
  widgets or gadgets.

o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below
  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib
  functions because Xt provides most such services although an
  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for
critical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of
the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the
appropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a
list traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that
behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls
any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem
specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other
functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that
these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.

The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the
interrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a
work procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either
of these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous
to add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively
preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never
be called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop
about the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler
can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.
However, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.

Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it
is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating
system.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.

        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly
Volume 6 are in error.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has
three things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and
border pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap
resource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions
deals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these
resources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the
shell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen
and DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is
not properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is
created.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends
on the visual being used.  

How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The
first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual
and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application
to start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier
because the basic information you need is available.  The first is a
little harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit
yourself in order to determine the needed information.

/*
 * Some sample code to start up an application using something other
 * than the default visual.
 *
 * To compile:
 *	cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm
 *
 * To run:
 *	./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow
 *
 * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap
 * to install.

5.  Which visual should an application use?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is
no way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to
be specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your
application probably falls into the category of always using the
default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular
visual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some
such).

Why?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server
allocates resources I may not always want your application to run in
TrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may
be very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor
or just monochrome.

As an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different
possible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static
color, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above 
plus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary
widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the
shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that
shell.

A widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have
its own realize method to use the visual when it calls
XCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be
obtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A
reasonable value is probably XtNvisual.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This
is interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()
and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.
it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.

If the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies
colormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the
visual.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some resource converters improperly cache references.  This was
especially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

See section 2.8 of the Xt specification.

It eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The
Intrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all
of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.
It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any
pending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned
up before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then
performed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have
completed, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the
list is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among
other things.

As some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the
Intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the
widgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs
immediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on
the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not
destroyed until returning to the outer event loop.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting
an application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget
may not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open
sockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for
simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):


	Widget
	ToplevelGet (gw)
		Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */
	{
		Widget		top;

		for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))
			/* empty */;
		return (top);
	}

	void
	ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)
		Widget		gw;		/* widget */
		XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */
		XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */
	{
		Widget		toplevel;

		toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);
		XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */
		XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);
		exit (0);
	}

One can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying
the toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never
occur.  

This works for most widgets and most applications but will not work
for those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that
since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the
reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant
of the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the
widget may change and someday require that some external state is
cleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.

One alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and
then test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private
event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and
difficult to maintain practices.

Try the following code instead.

	#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

	extern Widget ToplevelGet (
	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes
		Widget		gw
	#endif
	);

	extern Boolean ExitWorkProc (
	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes
		XtPointer	closure
	#endif
	);

	extern void ExitCallback (
	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes
		Widget		gw,
		XtPointer	closure,
		XtPointer	call_data
	#endif
	);

	Widget
	ToplevelGet (gw)
	Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */
	{
		Widget		top;

		for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))
			/* empty */;
		return (top);
	}


	void
	ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)
	Widget		gw;		/* widget */
	XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */
	XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */
	{
		Widget		toplevel;

		toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);
		XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */
		XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);
		XtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),
				  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);
	}

	Boolean
	ExitWorkProc (closure)
		XtPointer	closure;
	{
		exit (0);
		/*NOTREACHED*/
	}


ExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the
application is next idle -- which happens after all the events are
processed and the destroy callbacks are executed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
11. How do I resize a Shell widget?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

After it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper
thing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget
using XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the
Shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the
request.  However, the Shell must have the resource
XtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the
window manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.

To change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not
the child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does
not fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file
descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not
block, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to
block.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For
a file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF
-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always
calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to
be read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based
OS's it is the poll() system call.

How to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use
another process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe
to connect the application with this other process and pass the file
descriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on
BSD systems is ""tail -f filename"".

It's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_
reliable.  In particular:

	- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while
	  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other
	  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race
	  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.

	- Pyramid, doesn't work at all.

	- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as
	  sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing
	  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it
	  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at
	  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks
	  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having
	  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had
	  been given the whole block).


Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as
read(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and
may not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers
felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with
part of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this
point I don't know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective
it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full
details of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already
familiar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may
not find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, which
means its a 1000 pages.

Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., ""X Window System Toolkit, The
	Complete Programmer's Guide and Specification"", Digital Press,
	1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by
	Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC
	Direct at 1-800-DIGITAL.

The other book I commonly recomend to novices is:

Young, Doug. ""The X Window System: Applications and Programming with
	Xt (Motif Version),"" Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8).
	(ISBN 0-13-972167-3)

And of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt.
O'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt
reference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensively
overhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding it
very useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references to
other manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related
information.

I read two periodicals, ""The X Resource"" and the ""The X Journal"".
These are the only two dealing specifically with X.  ""The X Resource""
is published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being the
MIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is no
advertising.  I've found it informative with pretty good depth.  For
orders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorial
matters, email adrian@ora.com.  Table of contents are posted at
math.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in
~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form.


""The X Journal"" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising.
The articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical
audience.  I read it more to see what's going on then with an
expectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent a
fairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty good
collection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call
(908) 563-9033.

14. What Widgets are available?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are three popular widget sets:

Athena	- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most
	  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is
	  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z.
Motif	- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on
	  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but
	  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think
	  it is poorly implemented.
OLIT	- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets
	  implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by
	  AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality.
	  I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.

In addition the following collection of widgets are also available:

Xtra	- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software
	  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked
	  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,
	  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen
	  them so I can't comment.
FWF	- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of
	  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,
	  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets
	  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine
	  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z.
Xcu	- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the
	  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for
	  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so
	  widely used.
Xs	- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but
	  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise.
Xw	- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written
	  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.
	  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.
	  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was
	  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided
	  much experience for the designers of Xt.
Xo	- A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you
	  can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*

The following specialized widgets are also available:

Tbl	- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif
	  widgets as children.  Part of Wcl.
Plots	- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).
	  Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.

15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

	__________________________________________
	Name		Language	Vendor
	__________________________________________
	Xview		C		Sun
	OI		C++		ParcPlace
	Interviews	C++		Stanford
	Tcl/tk		C		sprite.berkeley.edu
	__________________________________________


However much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and
implementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop
in the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep
your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language
other than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)
	typdef struct
	{	
	    String	name;
	    long	value;
	} Arg;

and the code:
	Arg	arg;

	XtSetArg (arg, ""name"", 3.2)

expands to
	Arg	arg;

	arg.name = ""name"";
	arg.value = 3.2;

you can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value
gets the integer ""3"" instead of the floating point value ""3.2"".  When
the value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is
wildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,
how to get around this?

The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now
recomending it over the previous suggestions.

#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \
    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \
        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \
    } else { \
        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \
        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \
    }


----------------------------------------------------------------------
17. How do I write a resource converter?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Courtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):

The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)
Intrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow
for destructors and caching of converted values.

There are several main types of resource converters:

    string to data type
    data type to string
    data type to data type

i) string to data type
    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings
    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often
    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:

	Name		Value
	""True""		1
	""False""		0

    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare
    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most
    readily accomplished by the use of the ""quark"" mechanism of the
    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,
    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a
    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the
    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.

    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many
    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then
    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the
    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of
    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks
    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one
    of the converters.

ii) data type to string
    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data
    type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,
    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,
    probably by the use of sprintf.

    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that
    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that
    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This
    mechanism can be used to provide a ""snapshot"" of application state
    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to
    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.

    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type
    converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to
    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure
    that they are consistent.

iii) data type to data type
    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type
    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be
    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for
    red, green and blue.


The type signature for a resource converter is as follows:

typedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,
	XrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);
    Display *dpy;
    XrmValuePtr args;
    Cardinal *num_args;
    XrmValuePtr fromVal;
    XrmValuePtr toVal;
    XtPointer *converter_data;

When the converter is invoked, the ""fromVal"" argument points to the source
X resource manager value and the ""toVal"" argument points to the
destination X resource manager value.  The ""converter_data"" argument
is an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified
when the converter is registered.  The ""args"" and ""num_args"" arguments
allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is
invoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed
above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the
Pixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.

Care must be taken with the ""toVal"" argument.  An XrmValue has the
following type definition and specifies a size and location for a
converted value:

typedef struct {
    unsigned int    size;
    caddr_t         addr;
} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;

When the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of
the given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.
In the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the
destination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If
the destination area is not large enough, then the converter should
set the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The
caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the
converter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply
copy the converted value into the space given and return True.

If the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to
the address of a static variable containing the converted value and
return True.

When writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it
becomes convenient to define a macro:

    #define DONE(var, type) \
      if (toVal->addr) \
	{ \
	  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \
	    { \
	      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \
	      return False; \
	    } \
	  else \
	    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \
	} \
      else \
	toVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \
      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \
      return True;

    #define DONESTR(str) \
      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \
	{ \
	  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \
	  return False; \
	} \
      else \
	toVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \
      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \
      return True;

Inside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety
checking on the ""num_args"" and ""args"" arguments to ensure that your
converter is being called properly.

Once you have written your converter, you need to register it with the
Intrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating
widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.

To register a converter with a single application context, use
XtAppSetTypeConverter:

void XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,
	cache, destructor)
    XtAppContext context;
    String from;
    String to;
    XtTypeConverter converter;
    XtConvertArgList args;
    Cardinal num_args;
    XtCacheType cache;
    XtDestructor destructor;

To register a converter with all application contexts, use
XtSetTypeConverter:

void XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,
	cache, destructor)
    String from;
    String to;
    XtTypeConverter converter;
    XtConvertArgList args;
    Cardinal num_args;
    XtCacheType cache;
    XtDestructor destructor;

In the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and
XtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter
and XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be
used.

When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a ""cache"" argument
specifies how converted resource values are to be cached:

    XtCacheNone		Don't cache any converted values
    XtCacheAll		Cache all converted values
    XtCacheByDisplay	Cache converted values on a per display basis

Caching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a
good idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).

The ""destructor"" argument is a routine that is invoked then the
resource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has
been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is
being destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:

typedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,
	XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);
    XtAppContext context;
    XrmValuePtr to;
    XtPointer converter_data;
    XrmValuePtr args;
    Cardinal *num_args;

The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated
with the ""to"" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed
to by the ""to"" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed
the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the
conversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments
for the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to
free the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private
data passed in when the converter was registered.

Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT
R5 distribution:

    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c

18. How do I open multiple displays?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

See ""Multi-user Application Software Using Xt"", The X Resource, Issue 3,
(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues
involved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a
nutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_
application context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display
and remove it from the application context.

The real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can
happen 3 ways:
	1. User selects a ""quit"" button on one of the displays,
	2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,
	3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,
	   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.

I'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a
problem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that
display.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.

The third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the
Oliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult
problem.

The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O
error is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true
for a single display X based application, but not true for a
multiple display program or an application that does things other than
display information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the
I/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()
happens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid
returning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment
demonstrates this:

#include <setjmp.h>
jmp_buf XIOrecover;

void
XIOHandler (dpy)
	Display		*dpy;
{
	destroyDisplay (dpy);
	longjmp (XIOrecover, 1);
}

main ()
{
	...
	if (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)
		XSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);
	XtAppMainLoop (app_context);
}

The destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go
back to the application specific data and perform any necessary
cleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().

For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is
first called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the
jmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to
the same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value
of this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to
longjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this
purpose it is adequate.

Some other problems you might run into are resource converters that
improperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors
such as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the
total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited
number of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical
value.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to
connect to a display.

There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in
November of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically
said this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
19. What changed from R3 to R4 to R5?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This addresses only changes in the Intrinsics.  First, the general
changes for each release are described.  Then a, certainly incomplete,
list of new functions added and others that are now deprecated are
listed.  Brevity is a primary goal.

Much of the following information is retrieved from Chapter 13 of the MIT
Xt Intrinsics Manual and from O'Reilly Volume 5, 3rd edition.

From R3 to R4
- Addition of gadgets (windowless widgets)
- New resource type converter interface to handle cacheing and
  additional  data.
- Variable argument list interface.
- #define XtSpecificationRelease 4  (added with this release)
- WMShellPart, TopLevelShellPart & TransientShellPart changed
  incompatibly.
- core.initialize, core.set_values added ArgList and count parameters
- event handlers had continue_to_dispatch parameter added
- core.set_values_almost specification changed.
- core.compress_exposure changed to an enumerated data type from Boolean
- core.class_inited changed to enumerated data type from Boolean
- constraint.get_values_hook added to extension record
- core.initialize_hook obsolete as info is passed to core.initialize
- shell.root_geometry_manager added to extension record
- core.set_values_hook obsolete as info is passed to core.set_values
- Calling XtQueryGeometry() must store complete geometry.
- Added UnrealizeCallback.
- XtTranslateCoords() actually works under R4.

From R4 to R5:
- Psuedo resource baseTranslation added.
- Searching for app-default, and other files, made more flexible
- customization resource added.
- Per-screen resource database.
- Support permanently allocated strings.
- Permanetly allocated strings required for several class fields.
- The args argument to XtAppInitialize, XtVaAppInitialize,
  XtOpenDisplay, XtDisplayInitialize, and XtInitialize were changed
  from Cardinal* to int*
- Many performance improvements (this is summarized from the article
  ""Xt Performance Improvements in Release 5"" by Gabe Beged-Dov in ""The
  X Resource"", Issue 3):
	- XrmStringToQuark() augmented with XrmPermStringToQuark() to
	  avoid string copies.  Several fields in the class record are
	  indicated as needing permanent strings.
	- Using an array of Strings for resources
	- Callback lists redesigned to use less memory
	- Translation manager redesigned and rewritten so it takes
	  less memory, translation tables merges are faster, cache of
	  action bindings
	- Keycode to Keysyms are cached.
	- Better sharing of GC's with modifiable fields
	- Window to Widget translation uses less space and faster
	- Does not malloc space for widget name since quark is available
	- Widget space is allocated to include the constraints
	- Over several example programs, about a 26% reduction in
	  memory usage.

20. Where are the resources loaded from?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places
(from highest priority to lowest priority):

	1. Args passed at creation time.
	2. Command line arguments.
	3. User's per host defaults file
	4. User's defaults file.
	5. User's per application default file.
	6. System wide per application default file.

Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result
of steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.

The per host defaults file contains customizations for all
applications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either
specified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not
set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.

The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER
property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then
the file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program ""xrdb"" is
used to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this
should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the
display must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is
reasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER
but most do not.

A user may have many per application default files containing
customizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite
flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes
the various environment variables and how they effect where this file
is found.

The system wide per application default files are typically found in
/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the
fallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how
this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various
environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.

[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]

You can use several environment variables to control how resources are
loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables
control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an
application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file
from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path
defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.

Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a
way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory
hierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open
Windows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in
/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for
XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files
in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your
OPENWINHOME is located):

	setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N

The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of
pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows
(see XtResolvePathname()):

	%N	The value of the filename parameter, or the
		application's class name.
	%T	The value of the file ""type"".  In this case, the
		literal string ""app-defaults""
	%C	customization resource (R5 only)
	%S	Suffix.  None for app-defaults.
	%L	Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. ""ja_JP.EUC"")
	%l	Language part of %L  (e.g. ""ja"")
	%t	The territory part of the display's language string
	%c	The codeset part of the display's language string

Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is
""Myterm"". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.
(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)

	/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm
	$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm

As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above
app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it
reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of
this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.

Let's consider another example. This time, let's set
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current
working directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.

	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N

The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands
to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for
debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the
app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so
you can run the application from the directory in which you are
working and still have the resources loaded properly.

NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,
      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is
      defined so %T and %S are useless.

With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization
resource value.  For example, you might run the ""myterm"" application
like this:

	myterm -xrm ""*customization: -color""

If one of your pathname specifications had the value
""/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C"" then the expanded pathname would be
""/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color"" because the %C substitution
character takes on the value of the customization resource.

The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:

		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\     (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\
		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\
		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N

(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this
batch of default settings.)

The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is 

		<root>/%L/%N%C:\  (R5)
		<root>/%l/%N%C:\  (R5)
		<root>/%N%C:\     (R5)
		<root>/%L/%N:\
		<root>/%l/%N:\
		<root>/%N:

<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory
if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some
value other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.

Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find
your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set
XAPPLRESDIR to ""."", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked
differently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR
value to ""./"", a dot followed by a slash.

21. What order are callbacks executed in?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)

The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because
both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to
modify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one
currently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot
guarantee the order of execution.

The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the
widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and
remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;
therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be
independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the
list.

Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback

 	""callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the
 	procedure is to be appended.""
 
you may not infer from the word ""appended"" that the callback routines
are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback
list.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
22. How do I know if a widget is visible?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)


Right, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a ""deficiency""
in the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the
protocol.  (The ""deficiency"" is that the information is available in one way,
in this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in
the second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section
carefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.

A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from
viewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;
that is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.
Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;
see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.


You'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.


As an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action
routine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget
which contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the
map_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are
suggestions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can't.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()
tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is
handled something like:

	ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))
	if (!ptr)
	{
		perror (""malloc in xyzzy()"");
		exit (1)
	}
To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions
XtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which
all use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and
realloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt
error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.

In addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses
XtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:

	if (!ptr)
		ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));
	else
		ptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));
	++count;

to be written as:

	ptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);

Also, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I've
found the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'm
allocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so
I can fully recover from not enough memory errors.

XtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a
structure or copying a string:

	  struct abc *xyzzy;
	  char	     *ptr;
	  char	     *str = ""abcdef"";

	  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);	/* takes care of type casting */
	  ptr = XtNewString (str);

A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an
implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with
malloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:

	 char	      *ptr;

	 ptr = XtMalloc (100);
	 /* ... */
	 free (ptr);

may not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did this
broken and complain to the vendor.

A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string
when they should really be using XmStringFree().

----------------------------------------------------------------------
25. How to debug an Xt application?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
First, I'd recomend getting ""purify"" from Pure Software.  This is a
great package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey
at $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb
(contact support@pure.com for more info).

	Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into
	the object code produced by existing compilers.  These
	instructions check every memory read and write performed by
	the program under test and detect several types of access
	errors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past
	malloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts
	checking logic into all of the code in a program, including
	third party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies
	system call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory
	usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel
	adaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly
	comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program
	down typically by a factor of two to five.

An alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on
many Unix's and has pretty similar features is ""The SENTINEL Debugging
Environment"".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library
functions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com
for more info)

Next, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run in
synchronous mode, easily accomplished with the ""-sync"" command line
argument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then
set a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the
original Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous
mode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to
Xlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the
server are asynchronous.

Next, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the
undocumented resource ""xtIdentifyWindows"" or the class resource
""XtDebug"" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.
For example:

    example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &
    example% xwininfo -tree
	     <click in new xload window>

will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each
window is included.  This can help for checking the location and size
of errant widgets.

Next, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to
test the way a widget manages it's children, you can try
export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter
between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour
of both.  It's a very clever idea.

The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the
application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from
a pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to
go to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server
locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else
can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped
waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.
Unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to
your application which is stopped.

The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on
your desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)
on one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly
using a command sequence like this:

	othermachine% xhost +thismachine
	thismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;
	thismachine% gdb application	# Your favorite debugger.
	or this:
	othermachine% xhost +thismachine
	thismachine% gdb application
	(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0
	(gdb) run ...

I believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method
of dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to
release any grabs during breakpoints.

Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and
knowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing
the internals of a particular widget but not very far without
understanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional
breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great
deal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,
   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when
   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.
   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works
   perfect, but in my ""real"" application nothing happens. 

The introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those
routines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is
they use a default application context different then the one you may
have created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per
application context basis and you are using two application contexts,
you won't get those events.

For example:

	...
	cnt = 0;
	toplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,
				   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),
				   &argc, argv,
				   Fallback, args, cnt);

	XtAddTimeOut (...)
	XtAddWorkProc (...)

	XtAppMainLoop (app)

would never invoke the timeout.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)

Drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an
``intuitive'' fashion.

Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has
supported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with
each other, and so far as I know, they are not published.

I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public
protocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My
intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to
support a ""standard"" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop
and contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long
as it is based on Xt).

The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM
conventions, for more details read the code.

I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that
it works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to
be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif
anyway.

The latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from
netcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.  A (possibly older) version is also
available on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib.",5
"A ""new Christian"" wrote that he was new to the faith and 
learning about it ""by reading the Bible, of course"". I am not
at all sure this is the best path to follow.
	While the Bible is, for Christians, the word of God, the 
revelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of this
revalation is the Church. I am not recommending any one
denommination, but I do recommend finding a comfortable christian
congregation in which to develop your faith, rather than just
reading the Bible.
	This does not mean that the Bible should not be read, although
I would stick to the Gospels, epistles, and Psalms and avoid the
Book of Revelation altogether [until you are with friends you are
comfortable with]. I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects to
read the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable
lack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the really
sturdy, somewhere in Chronicles.
	The point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith
of Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vital
beliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned -
the Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Church
organization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from the
lived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived one
hopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studies
in the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading.
	Following up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I 
would even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the
christian life. [Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing
the nature of good and evil in the human heart]. My own induction into
the christian faith was brought about [after grace] through reading
Graham Greene: _The Power and the Glory_ and the poetry of Gerard
Manley Hopkins. I would also recommend Graham Greene's _Monsignor
Quixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian,
but such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly,
I often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after
reading many parts of the Bible. And that after all is what being
a Christian is all about: letting your soul and your life be, in
some way, directed towards the infinite, represented to us by
the person of Jesus Christ.",15
"My wife's ob-gyn has an ultrasound machine in her office.  When
the doctor couldn't hear a fetal heartbeat (13 weeks) she used
the ultrasound to see if everything was ok.  (it was)

On her next visit, my wife asked another doctor in the office if
they read the ultrasounds themselves or if they had a radiologist
read the pictures.  The doctor very vehemently insisted that they
were qualified to read the ultrasound and radiologists were NOT!

My wife is concerned about this.  She saw a TV show a couple months
back (something like 20/20 or Dateline NBC, etc.) where an expert
on fetal ultrasounds (a radiologist) was showing all the different
deffects that could be detected using the ultrasound.

Should my wife be concerned?  Should we take the pictures to a 
radiologist for a second opinion? (and if so, where would we find
such an expert in Chicago?)  We don't really have any special medical
reason to be concerned, but if a radiologist will be able to see
things the ob-gyn can't, then I don't see why we shouldn't use one.

Any thoughts?

As many people have mentioned, there is no reason why insurers could not
offer a contract without abortion services for a different premium.
The problem is that there is no guarantee that this premium would be
lower for those who chose this type of contract.  Although you are
removing one service, that may have feedbacks into other types of covered
care which results in a net increase in actuarial costs.

For an illustrative example in the opposite direction, it may be possible
to ADD services to an insurance contract and REDUCE the premium.  If you
add preventative services and this reduces acute care use, then the total
premium may fall.",19

not watch the game why would they decide to show most of the game? And
if they showed the remaining 2.5 hours of the game, would it hurt to play
David Brinkley at its regular time? They dont have any decent programming
before noon anyway. I called the sports dept and blasted them on their

You're assuming that their normal rotation carries all areas of the surface
into sunlight.  Not so.  Even on Earth, each pole gets several weeks without
sunlight in mid-winter.  Pluto and Charon have much more extreme axial
tilt and a much longer orbit.  Pluto's north pole, for example, gets over
a century of darkness followed by over a century of perpetual light.

At the moment, we're in luck -- Pluto and Charon are just past their

Of course, with the Jets gone to Jersey (and a truly good football

My votes (FWIW):

Team MVP: Pat Verbeek. He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has 
36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain
throughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and
Mark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than
MVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on
the team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess
I place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.

Biggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season
as a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+
points. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming
from the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew
Cassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and
Petrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23
and will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the
role of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake
bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put
up about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started
performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, 
although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the
right side.

Biggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77
point season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started
the season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,
since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).
Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded
the powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his
way out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left
to run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the 
Maple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar
after signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of
competence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better
hockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only
seemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got
to make a number of starts in a row.",10

All five schools of law (to the best of my knowledge) support the
death sentence for apostasy WHEN it is accompanied by open, persistent,
and aggravated hostility to Islam. Otherwise
I agree, there is no legal support for punishment of disbelief.
The Qur'an makes it clear that belief is a matter of conscience. Public
or private disavowal of Islam or conversion to another faith is not
punishable (there are some jurists who have gone against this

Not true! Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality
at any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs
related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason
for your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the
market today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font
vendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being
hand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted
TT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin.

TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting
of diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the
Windows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can
be done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not
just converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.


Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone
converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT
allows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs
in a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate
for the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack
2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that
if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.



Hope this clears up some of the confusion. Feel free to contact me if anyone would like
more info.

* The WITNESS Of The APOSTLE PAUL:  1 Corinthians 15:1-26

 1 Now I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to
   you, which also you received, in which also you stand,

 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I
   preached to you, unless you believed in vain.

 3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received,
   that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,

 4 and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day
   according to the Scriptures,     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 5 and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.

 6 After that He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one
   time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep;

 7 then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles;

 8 and last of all, as it were to one untimely born, He appeared to me
   also.

 9 For I am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called an
   apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me did
   not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not I,
   but the grace of God with me.

11 Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.

12 Now if Christ is preached, that He has been raised from the dead,
   how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?

13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, not even Christ has
   been raised;

14 and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, your
   faith also is vain.

15 Moreover we are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we
   witnessed against God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise,
   if in fact the dead are not raised.

16 For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised;

17 and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are
   still in your sins.

18 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.

19 If we have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are of all men most
   to be pitied.

20 BUT NOW CHRIST HAS BEEN RAISED FROM THE DEAD, the first fruits of
   those who are asleep.

21 For since by a man came death, by a man also came the resurrection
   of the dead.

22 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.

23 But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after that those
   who are Christ's at His coming,

24 then comes the end, when He delivers up the kingdom to the God and
   Father, when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.

25 For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.

26 The last enemy that will be abolished is death.


             LOGICAL PROOFS OF JESUS CHRIST'S RESURRECTION

            1.  Jesus's enemies *would not* have stolen His
                body because that would have perpetrated the
                resurrection--the very opposite of what they
                desired.

            2.  Jesus' disciples *could not* have stolen His
                body because Pontius Pilate established guards
                to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be
                stolen.

            3.  Sadly (and ironically), many of Jesus' disciples
                did not believe in the Resurrection until Jesus
                had risen from the dead.

            4.  In nearly 20 centuries, no body has ever been
                produced to refute Jesus' assertion that He
                *would indeed* rise from the dead.",15

Actually, they generally claim that (b) their particular interpretation of
scripture/revelation *is* this objective morality.  That there are two
conflicting versions of this objective morality does tell us something about
(a).  It tells us at least one fake objective morality exists.

The next logical step is to deduce that any given religion's objective
morality could be the fake one.  So caveat emptor.

[FAQ and Darius' response deleted]



I am myself an SDA and I am in total agreement with what Darius has to say.  
I also worship on Saturday to honor the Lord.  Your mention of ""[esteeming] 
all days alike"" IMO has to do with the fast days observed by the Jews.  But 
no matter how you interpret that passage, I do accept your worship on Sunday 
as being done in honor of the Lord, in contrast with what many of my fellow 
SDA believers may believe.  To me, though, the bible overwhelmingly points 
to Saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of God's 
deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.  To those who would 
attempt to point out that my observance of Saturday is being legalistic, 
this is simply not the case.  Rather, keeping Saturday allows me a full day 
to rest and contemplate God's goodness and grace.



The idea was introduced to me once that the reason Paul wanted the 
Corinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the first day of the 
week was because that was when they received their weekly wages.  Paul 
wanted them to lay aside money for the collection as first priority, before 
spending their money on other things.  I do not have any proof in front of 
me for this though, although it would explain why they would lay aside money 
in their homes instead of a meeting.  


It would seem to me that you assume that the christians in the NT regularly 
worshipped on the first day.  I assume that the christians in the NT 
regularly worshipped on the seventh day.  But I agree with you that we only 
have implications because the authors did assume the reader knew when worhip 
was.",15

"It might pay to start looking at what this proposal might mean to a
police agency.  It just might be a bad idea for them, too.

OK, suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone.  They
need a warrant, just like the old days.  But unlike the old days, they
now need to 

   (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of
       the key.

Now, what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses?
Posession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.  State
and lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics,
while potentially good leads disappear, lives and property are lost,
statutes of limitations run out, etc.  Not to mention: a moderately
clever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buying
new phones faster than tap requests can be processed.  Or using stolen
ones.  [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting
without a dialing license?]

There's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house, 
how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated?  Put in enough
safeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with, and 
it might take a LONG time to get that key.  [Even when a request is approved, 
how is the key going to be disclosed?  Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-type
chip for transmission?  In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal
Government, with a databank of the necessary size, and data traffic of
the projected volume, there's going to be a lot of weak links.  How many of 
these kinds of problems will be open for public or ""expert"" scrutiny?]  

Furthermore, the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around, 
even to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue.  This would be 
an especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a 
key, resulting in lawsuits, financial settlements, and political 
embarassment.  So, the Feds implement it this way:
 
   (b) some federal agency gets the keys, performs the tap, and
       turns the results over to the NY State Police.

But let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a Clinton
Aid-To-Urban-Areas proposal.  Or there just happens to be a turf war
going on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case.
Now, not only do we have the keys as a political chit, we have an
extra player in the game *and* we have the tap's tapes as another
bargaining chit.  Again, the State Police lose.

I understand that (legal) wiretaps are quite expensive to maintain. In

"Here is the MacWeek article describing the DUO ram situation.
(w/o permission.  I hope that is ok)

Jose

Bad RAM brings some Duos down. (random access memory boards for Apple
Macintosh PowerBook Duos) 
MacWEEK v7, n7 (Feb 15, 1993):132.

COPYRIGHT Coastal Associates Publishing L.P. 1993

By Raines Cohen

     Austin, Texas - Some third-party memory-expansion cards for PowerBook
Duos depart from Apple specs in ways that could cause crashes, data loss
and other problems.

     Technology Works Inc., a RAM and network vendor based here, last week
issued a warning about three problems it said it had found in Duo RAM
products from some competing vendors, which it declined to identify.
Other vendors and an Apple spokeswoman confirmed that the problems exist.

     > Self-refresh.  The Duos require a kind of dynamic RAM called
selfrefreshing, which can recharge itself while the system sleeps.  But
Technology Works said some vendors have sold Duo cards with
nonselfrefreshing DRAM, which can cause the system to lose data or fail to
wake from sleep.

     Most leading memory manufacturers include the letter V in the part
number stamped on their self-refreshing chips; nonself-refreshing chips
instead have an L, according to TechWorks.  The chip label, however, may
not tell the whole story.  Newer Technology of Wichita, Kan., said it uses
nonself-refreshing chips but adds its own circuitry to keep them refreshed
while the Duo sleeps.

     > Speed.  Some RAM-card vendors have put 80-nanosecond DRAM on Duo
cards rather than the 70-nanosecond type the 230 requires, Technology
Works said.  However, some chips labeled as 80- or 85-nanosecond are
certified by the manufacturer to run at a higher speed.

     Kingston Technology Corp. of Fountain Valley, Calif., said it offers
Duo RAM cards with 80-nanosecond chips, but only for the Duo 210, which is
compatible with the slower chips.

     > Space.  Technology Works charged and Apple officials confirmed that
some third-party cards are too large to fit properly, forcing the corner
of the Duo keyboard up and preventing the system from starting up normally
when in a Duo Dock.",4

"

The Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God (Romans 13).
 And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It is
just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the
inevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard to
grasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are
doing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it
must be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to
the final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is
possible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the
eyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts
now rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing
people for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and
Annias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His
plan might be accomplished.
    But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to
execute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to
fulfill the chorus of ""Let his blood be upon our hands"" of the crowd in
Jersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel,
which was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish
other nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament. 
Don't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, ""Mene, mene,
tekel, peres?""  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's
justice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians
as their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the
extirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel. 
The Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and
the Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go
on with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is
quite clear.
Two things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to
question why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom,
He made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans
9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of
Jesus Christ is as follows: ""Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
hand.""  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - ""Let
the dead bury the dead, come, follow me.""  There is not an infinite
amount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to
follow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, ""well, alright,
you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your
plans.""  He said ""Follow me.""  His message is NOT ""I'm just a sweety-pie
who would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, and
Divine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale.""  ""Our great God and Savior""
Jesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the
world.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be
questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.",15

Well people fortunatly or unfortunatly ,
only the US is experiencing the devaluation of human life (among 
developed nations).

I am an American but I was raised in Europe, where the worst thing that 
can happen to somebody is get his car broken into, or have his pocket
picked by Slaves or Russian refugees.

Of cource there will be some nutcases, but thats extremely rare.

I.e. in Greece you can walk through any neighborhood at any time during
the night without even worrying.

In Germany , you can walk the sidewalks at 4.00 am and not even look 
behind your back, at the sanitation crews that clean the streets to a 
sparkling cleen.

Whoever of you have been there you know what I am saying.

I dont have any easy answers but if we as a nation do some selfcritisism
we might get somewhere.

Of course these postings sould be in soc.culture.US but if we reduce
crime here it 'll mean less car insurance rates ,thus we could spend
more money on modifing our cars. (Now my posting is rec.autos.tech

I know this is just setting myself up, but this is actually one of the
things that is really good about BMW bikes.  From all accounts I've
heard practically no one steals BMWs. Probably it is similar for Moto

Yes, that is most certainly true. However, the paragrapgh reflects a value-less
position and infers that what is more important than anything else is to
have ""a positive view"" of one's self.

This of course, is foolish.

Should a mass murderer, a pedophile, a 10-year old pyromaniac have a ""positive

Of course not.

A person that engages in behaviour that a large number of people condemn,
and IF you believe in the concept of ""society"", then your only choice is
to expect that person to have a negative view of themselves.

	Alan, you can start by teaching your children that the perpetrators
of crimes no more represent the ""Black community"" than racist hateful Whites
represent the majority culture (although there are many ethnic minorities
who have fallen into the very trap that you are struggling with, and believe
otherwise). The trap is the easy way out.
	For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the
demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race,
and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You're
going to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic
group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors
leading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than
not, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.
	If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few
Blacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crime
statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then
worry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable
or whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to
define ""us"" and ""other"" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous
when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational
humans.
	It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the
*most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racial
makeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live in
San Francisco, a city that loves to tout its ""ethnic diversity"". Here, we
have Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the ""model minority"") gangs,
and even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly
troublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their
propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on
the street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and
crime are what they most fear. During the ""disturbance"" in Los Angeles last
year many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I
remember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs
where there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned
from TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives
that live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first truly
multi-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that
in the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black*

	In closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting points
that really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the
racism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As
a people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem
becomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly
believe that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current
course of denial and repression.

"Eric (""Damien""?) was presenting his views on Christianity; I'll
respond to a few of his points:


This is certainly a valid objection to religion-as-explanation-of-
nature.  

Fortunately for the convenience of us believers, there is a class of
questions that can never be reduced away by natural science.  For
example: why does the universe exist at all?  After all, the time-space
world didn't have to exist.  Why does *anything* exist? And: is it
possible for persons (e.g. man) to come into being out of a purely
impersonal cosmos?  These questions which look at the real mysteries of
life -- the creation of the world and of persons -- provide a permanent
indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be
found *outside* that world, in its Source.



When you say that man is *only* an animal, I have to think that you are
presenting an unprovable statement -- a dogma, if you will.  And one
the requires a kind of ""faith"" too.   By taking such a hard line in
your atheism, you may have stumbled into a religion of your own.

But before you write off all Christianity as phony and shallow, I hope
you'll do a little research into its history and varieties, perhaps by
reading Paul Johnson's ""A History of Christianity"".  From your remarks,
it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of Christian
religion and not others.  Even an atheist should have enough faith in
Man to know that a movement of 2000 years has to have some depth, and
be animated by some enduring values.

I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an
object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital
velocity.  For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth,
you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specific
impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry
weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer.
A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or
birdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be
the payload.  I am sure the whole project is well within
the capability of the amateur rocketry community.

It sounds like a good Science Fair project--'Reduction
of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics'.
Or, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed
here: $1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year
on the moon, $1 million for the first erradication of
an orbital eyesore/CCD burner.  I wouldpledge $1000
for the first person to bring it down, and I am sure
there are at least 999 other astronomers, nature lovers,
or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise.

Of course, a  Gerald Bull solution might be simpler.

of a large caliber gun; or the solution which was applied

There's only one physical size for VRAM SIMMs (unlike DRAM SIMMs which 
come in many, many sizes and pinouts), although they do come with 
differing amounts of VRAM on them.  The ones you need are 256KB SIMMs, are 
organized as 128K x 16, and have two 128K x 8 VRAM chips on them.  This is 
the only size which the Quadra and Centris machines can use.


Two.


Both SIMM slots must be filled; putting a SIMM in only one slot does 
nothing for you.


80 ns for the Q800 and C650, 100 ns for the C610.


There are certain VRAM chip manufacturers whose parts are not compatible 
with the Quadra and Centris video hardware.  Make sure that the source you 
get them from guarantees compatiblity.  In general, if it works in a Q950,
it will work in a Q800.

In four replies, I've seen no hard numbers, so here goes:  For traces
on the outside (not inner layers), expect, in 1 oz copper, at 15 amps,
the following temperature rises versus width.  This is from Sams'
""Reference Data for Engineers,"" seventh edition, Pg 5-30, which claims
in turn to be from MIL-STD-275C...

    width   Temp rise
    inches  degrees C
    ------  ---------
     .125	100
     .15	 75
     .17	 60
     .20	 45
     .24	 30
     .33	 20

At 10 amps, the rise for the .125 width is only about 30 degrees.
Power goes as square of the current, plus the copper resistance goes
up as temperature goes up...  Certainly .20"" (~5mm) traces should be 
ample for what you want to do.  And 2 ounce copper almost cuts the 
required width in half.  (I'd do 2 oz at about 0.08"" width myself, 
I think...given that the _rated_ current is 10 amps and the 15 is
a transient or fault condition.)",12

"Clipper Chip is a response to the fact that there is no business
or professional body in a position to establish a standard and
provide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission
systems.

RSA might be in position to do it, if they had active cooperation of
a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones.

Large companies in the voice/data comm business are out, because they
all have contracts with the gov which would be used to pressure them.

If we, as professionals in crypto organizations, EFF, etc. were to
put our collective minds and interests toward establishing a
crypto standard for transmission, and getting our companies to
implement it, we might avoid government control.

Otherwise, I think it will happen to us by default.  Gov isn't probably
strong enough or foolish enough to prevent strong crypt.  They
are strong enough, and we may be foolish enough, to push through
the Clipper Chip.

Is RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this?  I, for one,
would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.

If not this, we should provide an algorithm which can be implemented
in either SW or HW and publish it, then push to make it the defacto
standard in the way that PGP and RIPEM are becoming such.

I think the original post was searching for existing implementations of
f.i. Gouroud-shading of triangles. This is fairly complex to do with plain
X. Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie
where to get the latest version).
For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension
only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window
with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable
'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(),
what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes
or such stuff.

To speak about POVRay, the X previewer that comes with the original source
package is not that good, especially in speed, protocol-friendlyness and
ICCCM compliance. Have a look on x256q, my own preview code. It is on

141.76.1.11:pub/gfx/ray/misc/x256q/

<Moral Driver distinctions deleted>


Compare the Driver to an urge such as Jealousy, where there is an urge
and an ""object"". The jealousy does not technically exist until the object
is apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there
even though it is not detectable.

Your description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but
I get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions
can sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven't attempted to
define the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of
each Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a
similar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is
easy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I
misunderstood?


My p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and
his writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do
my bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth)
is that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this
will probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that the
list of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element
may come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his
transactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what
gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.

I've had some more thoughts on my definitions:

I've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions
in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of
the Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a
graphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of
frequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being the
spectrum over time.

Conscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the
reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature
because Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often
unwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given
time which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with
Freud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the
urges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego,
I suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why
Conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is ""what
provides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?"". I think I need some
more time with this one.

That's about it for now!

Well, let me put it this way, based on my own experience.  A
general practitioner with no training in infectious diseases,
by establishing links to the ""Lyme community"", treating patients
who come to him wondering about lyme or having decided they
have lyme as if they did, saying that diseases such as MS
are probably spirochetal, if not Lyme, giving talks at meetings
of users groups, validating the feelings of even delusional
patients, etc.  This GP can go from being a run-of-the-mill
$100K/yr GP to someone with lots of patients in the hospital
and getting expensive infusions that need monitoring in his
office, and making lots of bread.  Also getting the adulation
of many who believe his is their only hope (if not of cure,
then of control) and seeing his name in publications put out
by support groups, etc.  This is a definite temptation.

The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre are in 'Milliyet' today.

69 year old Hatin Nine telling:

-''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told
me: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''

72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:

  Turks, you must die.''

28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:

- ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of
    my eyes.''

Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?
Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?

The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British
Journalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times
article. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before
Turkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures
of people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.

Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these ""lies."" They are saying
""exaggeration."" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the
situation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu
town was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's
3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...

The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of
this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.

Some of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability
to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.

Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print
no news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the
French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag
was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''

The age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots
of organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human
rights violations. International reactions must be made with international
cooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming
to be civilized.

Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the
right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where
is the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals,
journalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such
as France who are fast to claim leadership of ""human rights?""

While I honestly believe you believe you are doing a ""good thing"" by posting
that piece of propaganda, I believe the more people believe that the more they

you nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as
many as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life
I have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something
obviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are
innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an
abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not
support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian
Fundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants
your report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed
homosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that
there are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list.
I do not feel threatened by gays, I don't understand why others are.

The following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min-
istries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.

THE FOUNDER OF AN ""EX-GAY"" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO

by Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)

In December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaa
awards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE
INDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering
discontented gays and lesbians ""a way out of the homosexual death-style""
through prayer.  ""I'd like to give the award back,"" Caligiuri now laughs, ""I'm
no longer deserve it.""
  Caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national ""ex-gay"" movement peaked
with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well
as Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-
gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  ""There's no reality
in it,"" he says, ""I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.""
  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the
organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again
Christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who
are just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their
sexual urges and embracing Christianity.  ""We offer support to people who are
seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,"" explains Bob Davies, director of
Exodus.  He ventures that ""about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo-
sexuality are men.""
  ""Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting
their time,"" says Lisa Seeley, a former ""redeemed lesbian"" who worked with
Caligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  ""These
organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.""
  ""It's possible to change your identity or your behavior,"" says sex educator
Brian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. ""But it's really impossible to
change your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay,
but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.""
  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all
hell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both
their romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted
by a man he picked up in a bar.  ""I was really drunk,"" he recalls, ""and I
went home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all
night, and the next morning he raped me again.""
  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the
home he shared with his ex-lover.  ""He had another man there with him,""
Caligiuri recalls.  ""I thought at this time, 'If this is what being gay is
about, I don't want to be this way anymore.""
  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery
with others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix's
gay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its
first public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,
Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed
for hell.
  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks
in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  ""We were listed
under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,"" Caligiuri says, ""so people
thought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out
where the local bars were, and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo-
sexuality.""  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,
adding, ""They'll do anything to reach these people.""
  ""David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,"" recalls Peter
Kelly, a counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program, ""like that
he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.""
  Caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on
Raphael's syndicated talk show in 1985.  ""They were relieved,"" he recalls.
""They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better
that I should be a 'reformed' gay person.""
  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  ""By the time I appeared on Sally's
show,"" ""I'd started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline
and tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their
father.  I was horny all the time.""
  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his
numerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he ""used to go to bookstores
and get blowjobs.""  When he wasn't working the bookstores, he was sleeping
with other ""reformed"" homosexuals.
  ""I didn't realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex
with one another,"" Caligiuri says.  ""We'd go to conferences in other cities,
and we'd be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody
else.""
  By the time he appeared on 'AM Philadelphia' television show in May 1988,
Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show's
host asked him if he ever ""acted on temptation,"" his answer was a lie.
  Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him, however.  He was
suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating
yeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  ""I was too sick
to go to church,"" he explains.  ""The more time I spent away from those people
the more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.""
  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local
church and closed the ministry's doors.  ""I'd convinced myself that there
is no need in the world for ex-gay people,"" he says.
  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (""I'm interest-
ed in belief systems that aren't judgemental.""), considering romance (""But
not with a CHristian!""), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.
""I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,"" he says.  ""I want to
eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I
may have brought to our community.""

---end article---

Caligiuri's tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles
of former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay' ministries who have said very similar th
similar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have
come to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,
like Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian ""Lazarus Project"" of West
Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community
to bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values
of sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become
and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as ""Love In
Action"" and others, who either once claimed to have been ""reformed"" or who
were too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed
in them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of ""sealing"" their
new heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses
and bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of
night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous ""sin""
through a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch
has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-
cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet
the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow
gay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also
mrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and
fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on
them, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brain
functions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-
place.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the
threat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington's
_""Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact
based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as
Maury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser's _Come Hom!_.  I
seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and
self-acceptance.",19

 'The most are inside houses. Come you and look.'
 'No, dammit! My stomach isn't-'
 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform. Him you must see.'
 ""We were under those trees by the mosque, in an open space....
 'I don't believe you,"" I said, but followed to a nail-studded door. The 
  man pushed it ajar, then spurred away, leaving me to check on the corpse. 
  I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and 
  went inside.

 The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for 
 its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an 
 iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black 
 with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As 
 the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face 
 up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what 
 was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted, 
 as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone, so 
 I'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his  
 slashed genitals.""

p. 363 (first paragraph). 

 'How many people lived there?'
 'Oh, about eight hundred.' He yawned.
 'Did you see any Turk officers?'
 'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.'

 ""The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me - 
 Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled
 so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into 
 laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense
 of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,
 Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would
 have been.

 From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....
 The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over
 the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last 
 scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags, 
 looms, even spinning-wheels.

 'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must 
 leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And 
 for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains. 
 Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in 
 a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'""

p. 354.

""At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole
 high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian,
 but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust
 of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on
 Moslem villages.""

p. 358.

""It will be three hours to take,"" Dro told me. We'd close in on three
 sides.
""The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,"" Merrimanov
said, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow.
""That is for morale,"" Dro put in. ""We must keep the Moslems in terror.""
""Soldiers or civilians?"" I asked.
""There is no difference,"" said Dro. ""All are armed, in uniform or not.""
""But the women and children?""
""Will fly with the others as best they may.""

p. 360.

""The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet 
 down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said 
 Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'

 Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets
 clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;
 then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the
 spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though 
 I heard our Utica brass roar.

 As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing
 of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,
 dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow
 puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.
 The came a shrill wailing.

 Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about
 house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in
 clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen
 were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.

 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape
 over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked
 breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by
 afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and
 the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.

 At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward
 Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and 
 tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,
 through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in-
 arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb.""

p. 361 (fourth paragraph).

""Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair, 
 large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble 
 where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet 
 had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between 
 the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun 
 dress.

 The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He 
 lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the 
 pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed 
 just below his neck, into the spine. 

 There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was 
 empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking 
 colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead.""

p. 358.

 ""...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled
  north. My hosts told me of their duty here: to keep tabs on brigands, 
  Turkish troop shifts, hidden arms, spies - Christian, Red or Tartar -
  coming in from Transcaucasus. Then they spoke of the hell that would 
  break loose if Versailles were to put, as threatened, the six 'Armenian'
  vilayets of Turkey under the control of Erevan...

  An Armenia without Armenians! Turks under Christian rule? His lips
  smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache. That's bloodshed - just

I wouldn't bet on it.

Arab governments generally don't care much about the Palestineans and
their struggle but find it useful for political purposes back home.
They are happy to leave the Palestineans largely under Israeli control
because that leaves the job of controlling them to the Israelis.  The
Israelis don't like this job any more than King Hussein of Jordan
liked it -- and he managed to kill them off at the rate of thousands
per month when they started an Intifada in Jordan.  The governments of
Syria, Lebanon and Egypt all feel similarly.  However, proclaiming
public support for the Palestinean war against Israel deflects
criticism from deep problems at home and lends an air of legitimacy to
even the most brutal Arab tyrants.

Arab *PEOPLE* probably aren't much more sympathetic.  Palestineans
have shown a willingness to destabilize and plunder in Jordan,
Lebanon and Kuwait and are viewed with suspicion elsewhere.

You might still be right in sympathy to the war against Israel, but I
suspect that many Arabs, far removed from the immediate border with
Israel (e.g. in Kuwait or Morroco), couldn't care less.

It also falls within the purview of the ACLU, but that doesn't mean
the ACLU (or the EFF) would be the most effective instrument to 
""win the hearts and minds"" in favor of access to cryptography. 

It's precisely slogans like ""cryptography makes censorship impossible""
which stand to torpedo any attempt to generate a broad consensus in favor
of encryption.  It is not true, and in the context of a public debate it
would be a dangerous red herring.  Advocates of strong crypto had better
prepare themselves to answer such charges in pragmatic terms that laypeople
and politicians can sympathize with. The usual mumblings about
Constitutional amendments are not enough.

"Hello,
  
  I'm investigating the purchase of an Object Oriented Application Framework.  I have
come across a few that look good:

  Zapp 1.1 from Inmark
  Zinc 3.5 from Zinc software
  C++/Views from Liant
  Win++ from Blaise

Some considerations I'm using:

  Being new to Windows programming (I'm from the UNIX/X world), the quality and
intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very 
important.  However, since I'm not adverse to learning the internals of Windows
programming, the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with
the native one.  I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction, just for the
sake of changing the API, are valuable.

  Since we will be developing for the 32bit Windows NT system the
memory management issues and issues particular to the Windows 3.1 API are less
important. 

  We will probably buy another C++ class library (something like Tools.h++ or Booch
components from Rational) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff
 (allocators etc...).  So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have.

The two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc, they seem to be the two
toolkits that have received the most attention from the media.  I was wondering if
anyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits (especially ZApp and Zinc).

A couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are:

ZApp
----
  Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and
    also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes.
  Has new fancy 3D-style controls available, and support for custom controls.
  Has a Windows NT version (Essential)
  Redirectable graphics display/output architecture (useful for printing)
  Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize.
  Seems to be the newcomer, this could be an advantage in designing a better system.
 
Zinc
----
  Has a platform independent resource strategy.  (Not too important for me right now)
  Comes with a interface builder tool
  Has a Windows NT version (Essential)
  Seems to have been around longer (more mature), but grew up out of a DOS version.  
  Had a better demo :-)

Both have source code availability options
Both are lacking OLE support
Neither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff


Any thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated,

Thanks,
  Brett Harper

Good statement! Should we apply empirical measurements to define exact
social morals? Should morals be based on social rules? On ancient
religious doctrines? It seems there will *NEVER* be a common and single
denominator for defining morals, and as such defining absolute
and objective morals is doomed to fail as long as humans have 
this incredible talent of creative thinking.

I AM an Ulf (and Pgh) fan, and what pisses me off about the whole Adam Graves/
Ulf Samuesson debate is that Ulf plays hard-hitting hockey (nothing wrong with 
that) while Graves does what he does when the only way to win a game is to 
intentionally hurt someone (which bites!).


I thought they had instituted all kinds of new rules this season to stop crap 
like that?!?  Is it just me, or does the officiating just still stink to high

system with more than one ref on the ice to keep an eye on the trouble-makers
then a lot of these things would stop, and then the game would be ruled by the
finnesse players:  Mario, Selanne, Bure, Messier, et.al...

"There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today's
LA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I'd post it to
stir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by
saying that I largely agree that the ""Space Age"" in the romantic sense
of several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station
miss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, ""What's New"" -
the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the
romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of
matter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with
its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things
people are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I
think, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of
nostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our ""mind
children"" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but
I think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about
what we can do *now*.   

Anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...


SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW

Micheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)

At 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of a
midlife crisis.

The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no
longer define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion
-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic
rewards.  

Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's science
and technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a
meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our
technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion
policy.  

To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies
for telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes
would be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of
scientific and industrial innovation is now dead.

.....

Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to
write an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively
supported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion
to build space station Freedom alone.

Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,
Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken
public champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much
of the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope
to the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively
implemented did not seem to matter much.

Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent
vision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar
space budgets.

Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo
era is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration
with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  

......

While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel
Goldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being
positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America's
technological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been
slashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions
its competitiveness agenda.

Are you your own master?  Do you have any habits that you cannot break?
For one, you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand
even the slightest concept of the Bible.  Seems that ignorance has you
mastered.  How about sexual sins?  Gotta any of those secret desires
in your head that you harbor but can get control of?   Do you dehumanize
women when they walk past you?  Do you degrade them to a sex object in
your head?  Are you the master of that kind of thinking?  Do you insult
people unknowingly, then regret it later.  Yet do it again the next
time opportunity presents itself?  Are you truly the master of yourself?

I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times.
That I sometimes say things I do want to say, and then repeat my mistake
unwantingly.  I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect
of my being.  There are times I know I shouldn't say something, but
then say it anyway.  There are times I simply forget a lesson.
I, in fact, am not my own master.  I need help.  Jesus promised me
this help.  And I took him up on his offer.  I have willfully let
Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than
I myself do.  And why not?  Does not the creator know his creation
better than the creation?  Does Toyota know what's better for the
Corolla than the Corolla?


Then I guess ignorance is bliss for you.  Because Brian, you enjoy
not having a clue about the Bible.   



Can you witness motherly love with your senses?  How does caring and
concern for you register with your senses?  If nothing registers
to you other than what you can see, taste, smell, hear and touch,
then you better become a Vulcan and fast.  You better get rid
of your emotions.

And I do have a good reason to believe what I do.



The topic was about my God and your lack of knowledge about what my
God says.   My God says that you will not CEASE EXISTING.  You have
life forever.  You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal
torment where there is no communication whatsoever, or can choose to 
live it in paradise with God.  That is what my God says.  And that
was the issue.  Your made-up theism is what it is--made up.  It's
wishful thinking.
 

Is this the religion of Kendigianism?  Most people are not Christian.  Most
people, including Christians,  are not fond of feeling that they
are imperfect.  Is ""the world an undesireable place"" a doctrine
of Kendigianism?  It has nothing to do with my God.  Does
Kendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship?
Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again?  
Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the
priest tells them like good little sheep?  Mine doesn't.  Is this
a bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being 
ignorant of the Bible?

Brian, following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism.
You would find any of your doctrines in the Bible.   I don't follow Kendigianism.
I follow Christ.   Also, to try to again show you your ignorance
of Christ and the Bible in regards to ""priests"",  have you not read about
the sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8?  Have you not read what the
purpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should
NOT be priests today?  Yes, guess what?  The Catholics messed up.  I do
not follow Catholicism or any ""ism.""  I follow Christ.


Why would you want to live a good life?
To you, you die and that's it.  Don't contradict yourself.  You have
no reason to live a good life.  It doesn't do you any good in the
end.  Your life doesn't do anybody else any good  either because
everyone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading
a good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?


Has the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead.
Jesus was sacrified to fufill the Old Testament sacrificial system
in its every detail.  Jesus's death was like a seed.  He needed
to fall to the ground so that many new lives would take root.  Did
you miss the entire John passage as well?  



Forget that I am a person.  Forget that I know how to type.  Forget
that I know how to put a sentence together.  Forget that I know
how to send e-mail.   Forget my existence.  Proove to me that I
exist.  .

"Being a parent in need of some help, I ask that you bear with me while I
describe the situation which plagues me...

I am a divorced father. Chance would have it that ""my weekend"" with my 
daughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.

Although I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decided
that the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith
was too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a
date), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.

During the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church. 

When our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she 
be baptised as Catholic. This wasn't a problem with me.

During a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease
that affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward for
two months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated ""effectively"".

In other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.

During the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence over
my daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturday
visitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible study
books to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.

Last fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings.
At that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time,
I started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend.
I did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a
religious community.

Today, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for 
Communion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine
(The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then
balled the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the
pew in front of us.

I feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her
religious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments
if you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.

My daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old and
mature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directly
for religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with
my daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.

My initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith
in Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I
would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays
with her again.

I do not want to ""drive her from the fold"", and would be willing to allow her
to continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only
for two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.

Any suggestions?

If you have a response, please e-mail me a copy. (I'm not a regular reader
of this newsgroup.) (Naturally, feel free to post too!)

Thanks, and I hope you've had a happy Easter.

For years, we've been buying them from a distributor (Marshall) by the

I'd lost the White House's deathless prose when I posted (that's what happens
when you read news at home when you're rat-arsed), but I did have a bunch
of follow-ups going on about cellular/cordless comms.  The original article
has reappeared, so:

    The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
    the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
    program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
    communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
    enforcement.

Hmm, telephone communications could indeed include end-to-end encryption on
ordinary landlines.

    The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
    accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
    telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

But the next paragraph says telecoms networks and wireless communications
links.

OK, it's far from clear exactly what Cripple (what an apposite anagram) will
be applied to, but the reason Joe Public wants secure comms is to stop
people listening in to his cellular or cordless phones (and he wouldn't
even be bothered about that were it not for Wingnut and Squidqy's
misfortunes).

Yes, Cripple *might* be for end-to-end encyption, dropping to clear
when the other end doesn't have Cripple.  But then a cordless-to-ordinary
conversation would be in clear leaving the cordless end just as vulnerable
as at present.  Nope, I suspect that Cripple will only be used on radio
links.

OK, it's possible `telecommunications networks' could mean `ordinary phone
lines', but I'm betting it means the microwave links used by the telcos.

My apologies if I'm wrong, particularly if the turgid Press Release makes it
clear that I'm wrong and I missed it, but as far as I can see it was full of
obfuscation, and anyone expecting end-to-end encryption is in for a surprise
(IMHO).

I think that you are changing the meaning of ""values"" here. Perhaps
it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.

value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods
or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in 
usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality
considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as
of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus. 
The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or
lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech
sound. 

In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms
of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that
these definitions do not mean the same thing.

In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a
reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the
word ""value"" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard
of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its
basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one
concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on
systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a
scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as
""objective values.""

Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow.
Just because the word ""values"" is used in both contexts does not mean
that there is a relationship between the two contexts.

If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must
first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering
the meaning of the word ""objective"" I doubt that this will ever happen.

So, back to the original question:

And objective morality is.....?

If you can provide an objective foundation for ""morality"" then that will
be a good beginning.

I always like your kind of odds. The Greek governments must be held 
to account for the sub-human conditions of the Turkish minority living 
in the Western Thrace under the brutal Greek domination. The religious 
persecution, cultural oppression and economical ex-communication applied 
to the Turkish population in that area are the dimensions of the human 
rights abuse widespread in Greece.

""Greece's Housing Policies Worry Western Thrace Turks""

...Newly built houses belonging to members of the minority

by Evros province public works department on Dec. 4.

Sungar added that they had received harsh treatment by the

PKK, Greece and Greek Cypriot administration existed.

According to Demirok, Greek Cypriot administration not only 
gives shelter to PKK guerillas but also supplies them with 
food and weapons at the temporary camps set up in its territory. 
Demirok disclosed that PKK has three safe houses in South Cyprus, 
used by terrorists such as Ferhat. In the camps, he added, 
terrorists were trained to use various weapons including RPG's 
and anti-aircraft guns which had been purchased directly from 
the Greek government. Greek Cypriot government has gone to the 
extent of issuing special identification cards to PKK members so 
that they can travel from one region to another without being 
confronted by legal obstacles. Demirok's account was confirmed 
by another PKK defector, Fatih Tan, who gave himself over to 
police in Hakkari after spending four years with PKK. Tan explained
that the terrorists went through a training in camps in South Cyprus, 
sometimes for a period of 12 weeks or more.

       their training.  Mossad has established that  due to the
       clashes  which were  taking  place  among the  terrorist
       groups based  in Syria, the PKK  and ASALA organisations
       moved to  the Greek Cypriot  part of Cyprus,  where they
       would  be  more  comfortable. They  also  transferred  a
       number of  their camps in  northern Syria to the Troodos
       mountains.

       Mossad  revealed that  the  Armenian National  Movement,
       which is known as the MNA, has opened liaison offices in
       Nicosia, Athens and  Tripoli in order to  meet the needs
       of the  camps. The offices are used to provide  material
       support for the  Armenian  camps. Meanwhile, the  leader
       of the  Popular Front for  the Liberation of  Palestine,
       George  Habash, is  reported  to  have ordered  his  men
       not  to   participate  in  the  operations  carried  out
       by  the  PKK &  ASALA, which  he  described  as ""extreme
       racist,  extreme  nationalist  and   fascist.""  Reliable
       sources have said that  Habash believed that  the recent
       operations carried  out by the PKK  militants  show that
       organisation  to  be a  band  of  irregulars  engaged in
       extreme  nationalist  operations.  They  added  that  he
       instructed  his militants  to sever their links with the
       PKK  and avoid clashing with it. It has been established
       that George Habash  expelled ASALA  militants  from  his
       camp  after ASALA's  connections  with  drug trafficking
       were exposed.

                    Special to The New York Times

ATHENS, June 26 - A dispute developed today between Athens and 
Washington over United States intelligence reports saying that 
Athens, for several months, conducted negotiations with the
terrorist known as Abu Nidal...

They said the contacts were verified in what were termed hard
intelligence reports.

Abu Nidal leads the Palestinian splinter group Al Fatah 
Revolutionary Council, implicated in the 1985 airport 
bombings at Rome and Vienna that contributed to the Reagan 
Administration's decision to bomb Tripoli, Libya, last year.

In Washington, State Department officials said that when
Administration officials learned about the contacts, the
State Department drafted a strongly worded demarche. The
officials also expressed unhappiness with Greece's dealings
with ASALA, the Armenian Liberation Army, which has carried
out terrorist acts against Turks....

Assuming you are presenting it accurately, I don't see how this argument
really leads to any firm conclusion.  The material in John (I'm not sure
exactly what is referred to here, but I'll take for granted the similarity
to the Matt./Luke ""Q"" material) IS different; hence, one could have almost
any relationship between the two, right up to John getting it straight from
Jesus' mouth.


The version of the ""usual theory"" I have heard has Matthew and Luke
independently relying on Mark and ""Q"".  One would think that if Luke relied
on Matthew, we wouldn't have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies,
for one thing.


This is the part that is particularly new to me.  If it were possible that
you could point me to a reference, I'd be grateful.



Because it closes up the gap between (supposed) writing and the existing
copy quit a bit.  The further away from the original, the more copies can be
written, and therefore survival becomes more probable.




I'm not really impressed with the ""theology"" argument.  But I'm really
pointing this out as an ""if"".  And as I pointed out earlier, one cannot make
these arguments about I Peter; I see no reason not to accept it as an

not so bad.

"Hi netters,

I'm using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric
field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field.
In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters,
in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by 
PANEL_MAX_VALUE! 

As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls
number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't
work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h>
contains the following bit:

	/* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item,
	 * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes
	 */
	PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,			 152),
	PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,		 182),

which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders.
But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting
this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and return value 0.

Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me,
and clear this problem?

Any help is very much appreciated.

Here's a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station
with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the
incoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors
including atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time
dithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational 
equipment to ""back out"" the errors in its position (since it knows
where it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a 
broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local
receivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using
the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very
similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the
receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference
unit.

The US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series
of coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will
use existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately
305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals
on different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers
correction signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system
which has stations all across the US.

The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format.
Advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.

Um, surely you didn't intend to compare the '93 Reds with the
29 Philidelphia A's.  The Yankees were finishing 2nd to
a team that was as good as the 26-28 Yankees, while the
Yankees had aged some from their peak years.  Ruth and Gehrig
couldn't play every position simultaneously.

IMO, given the various ages of the Braves and Reds this season,
that the Braves will be closer to their peak, while the Reds
have slightly passed their peak.

Also, if you're going to compare Braves and Yankees, a more appropriate
comparison to the '93 Braves might be the '23 Yankees.  
After falling short two years in a row in exciting World Series,
 both teams won/will win the Series this year, despite the
heroics of some old fart on the other team.

"Now, I am jumping into the middle of this thread so I may not know
what y'all been talking about, but I have a few comments:


There are a number of other factors that are very important, the three
biggest being air velocity, air momentum and shock waves.
Velocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used inside
of stock airboxes on a number of bikes.  At a tuned engine rpm, the
stacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air
rushing in.
Air momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of
the air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside
long after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke.
Shock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from
escaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansion
chambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing)
to the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they
design for shock waves.",8

Yes, a point well-taken ... however, even in areas that finally got
some games, there's something nagging in the back of your skull when
the network that has the national rights in its pocket says on its

and we'll *try* to get you an update through the show ..."" when you
know that it's on a satellite's feedhorn somewhere up there ...


From today's Times, ABC got great ratings in Chicago and St. Louis (a
4.2), and the Kings-Flames got a 2.9 on the West Coast, but only a 2.2
in metro New York (i.e., the Devils squandered their newfound support
from a year ago when they played the Rangers )-;).  In comparison,
Seniors Golf did better ...


I fear that the overall national numbers will not be so great ...
I can't tell if ABC did any advance marketing or not, 'cos I don't
watch much TV ... the NHL should have made sure that it was solid
on cable before going on the air.  Even ESPN could've sold second

are not making any extra money by sitting on the games ... hockey

I am asking you to believe in things not visible. I don't know if this is
believeing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I do
not deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions
from evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on
the evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any
possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the
rather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere
is not self explanatory). 

Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence, 
which they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidence
is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The 
evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning
on the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reason
of the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly
consistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the
evidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself
to us.

It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come
through this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones
providing evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, be
physical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for
all we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for
reason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired
in some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense,
belief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.

Faith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source 
of evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beings
have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and
similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by
faith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use
reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding
of the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to be
the most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianity
claims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the
best evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.

If you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while
and you will see rational debate aplenty.",15

Gee. Say they feed the 80-bit key through Snefru-8 and take the first 60
bits of the result, then use those 60 bits as the real key. How do you
figure out that each key is one of 2^20 ``equal'' keys? You can try a
birthday attack, but if the key can be changed only once a second then
you will need several lifetimes to get reliable statistics. Somehow I
don't think you could catch the NSA at this sort of skulduggery.",11
"ATTN: Those who live inthe Philadelphia Metro area...

Back in September I was listening to WIP, and I remember the morning
guys were talking with Mayor Ed Rendell.  The topic of conversation
was a new ball park for the Phillies.  The location for this new park
was suggested to be near 30th St Station.  At the time, the mayor was
optimisitic that in the future this could become a reality.  Has
there been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream?
I know the city of Philadelphia has other projects ahead, such as the
new convention center and the upcoming Spectrum II.  But it would be
nice to see this a reality.  It is planned that the Phillies leave
the VET and leave it solely to the Eagles (and if that's the case,
the Eagles should make the VET a grass stadium, but that's another
story).  I want to see that day!",9

I disagree.  McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the
crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real-
istically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they
still go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the
game by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the
NBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is 
bringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are
trying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect 
examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being
benificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals
that would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to
attract, that these players are indeed superstars.



It ain't nearly so simple as this.  The casual fan doesn't think about much 
at all.  Can you actually find an adult with a 3 digit IQ who believes that
McDonalds makes good hamburgers?
 

Yes but apparently the Rocket has not lived up to his marketing responsi-
bilities has he?  He was hyped, initially, as a superstar, but outside of
one Grey Cup game he has done very little to maintain/enhance that assess-
ment of his talents.  Most Argo fans probably feel the team would be better
off without him.

I think the problem here is that I pretty much ignored the part
about the Jews sightseeing for 2000 years, thinking instead that
the important part of what the original poster said was the bit
about killing Palestinians.  In retrospect, I can see how the
sightseeing thing would be offensive to many.  I originally saw
it just as poetic license, but it's understandable that others
might see it differently.  I still think that Ken came on a bit
strong though.  I also think that your advice to Masud Khan:

  #Before you argue with someone like Mr Arromdee, it's a good idea to
  #do a little homework, or at least think.

was unnecessary.


Throughout all your articles in this thread there is the tacit
assumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual
anti-semitism.  If I agreed with that, then maybe your speech
on why this is bad might have been relevant.  But I think you're
reading a lot into one flip sentence.  While probably not
true in this case, too often the charge of anti-semitism gets
thrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the
state of Israel.

Anyway, I'd rather be somewhere else, so I'm outta this thread.",0

"I was watching the Dodgers/Marlins game yesterday and a couple of
things impressed me.  

First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami, it had a summer
atmosphere in early spring for baseball.  In comparison Wrigley Field
in early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and
bundled up fans.  

The second and most important was the fans.  I like these guys/gals!
I will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball.
It was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to
the Miami Dolphins.  The way they were cheering, I thought it was the
AFC playoffs.  Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it,
but I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking with
a lot of baseball fans in other cities.  

Baseball certainly needs a charge and I hope these two expansion
teams bring back some excitement.  We'll find out Friday how Denver
Bronco fans respond. ",9

Uh, right.  You also forgot that you can't get an RBI (barring a HR) with
nobody on base.  What fraction of all runs come on solo HR?

Most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the
batter did something good.  I use the phrase ""happened to be"" advisedly.
Lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the
most ability to ""turn it up a notch"" in clutch/RBI/whatever situations, and
what they've found is that there is no evidence that *anyone* has such an
ability to any measurable extent.  There are no clutch hitters.  People who
tend to do things that *would* cause an RBI if there were somebody on base
end up getting RBIs proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by
being in position.  


I agree.

"Has anyone had problems with Ami Pro 3.0 after running PCTools (v7.1)
compress?  I have not corrupted data due to having caches other than
PC-Cache running, so that is not it.  The first time I try to run Ami
Pro after loading windows, it loads, but causes (I think it was a) 
segmentation fault in AMIPRO.EXE right before it finishes, with all times
after that only managing to get to the logo box that first pops up when
it begins loading, and then causes a general protection fault in module
AMIPROUI.DLL at 0002:1147.  I have not been able to fix this problem except
by reinstalling Ami Pro.  This has happened twice, with both times being
after having ran compress on my hard drive.  BTW, I am not running stacker
or any other disk compression programs, and if you don't already know,
PCTools compress is actually a defragger, despite it's name.  My system is
a 386-40MHz, with 16MB of RAM and a NEC (OEM) hard drive, etc, but that
shouldn't make a difference.

"I'm buying a new system this week to replace my brain dead 286, and
could use some feedback on a couple systems I'm looking at if anyone is
familiar with them.
 
        The system that looks the most interesting is the Budget 486/66 VLB
tower.  For about $2343 (delivered) it offers VLB, 8MB, 200MB IDE, a Mitsumi
CD-ROM (with software bundle), Media Vision Sound board, 14"" CTX 1468NI,
128K Cache, and the usual drives, ports, & OS software.  Since my budget is
$2350 for a system, it seems almost too good to be true (which may mean it
IS too good to be true, of course). Among other things, I've never seen a
review of the Budget systems (or their parent company, Micro Smart), or of
the motherboard they are using (the Aetana). Any feedback would be
appreciated.
 
        In a similar vein, the second system I'm considering Midwest Micro's
Elite VESA 486/66 tower with a Diamond Viper (2MB) & Midwest Micro 14"" MI
monitor is one I've never seen reviewed anywhere.  I'm familiar with the
firm but not the product line - and some idea of their quality would be abig
benefit here as well.
 
        Any other suggestions in the price range would be appreciated - my
greatest needs are speed and graphics capabilities.

Not particularly *in* the World Series. During the season, he was probably
more valuable than, say, putting Olerud out there to pitch, but yeah, he
*was* valuable in getting them there. In the postseason, he sucked dirty
canal water through a straw. The Jays won *in spite* of Morris much more
than *because of* him.


Umm, Roger? Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago,
where the poster Valentine was replying to used # of WS rings as a measure
of better. The concept is called ""context"", and you should really become
familiar with it someday.


Unless this transaltes to ""Clemens hasn't gone into Lou Gorman's office with
a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he'd been traded to
the Jays,"" I'm at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.


What on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has ""won"" 68% of
the games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17
wins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing
the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If
so, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris
allows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in
his career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. But
I forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance
to Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it
would have been a routine groundout, right?


Speaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to
you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the
accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that
a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your
continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to
any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have
spent a few too many games in goal without a mask.


No one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win
at least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the
World Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they
keep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they
traded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link
between Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man
was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs
out, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992,
gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.

Seriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference
between the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher,
and why? Did Morris somehow ""learn how to win"" in the intervening ten years?
If so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half
a run lower than 1992?

Enemy?  Sounds like that's the viewpoint of the stereotypical rednecked
conservative -- 'always been commies, always will be.'  I suggest you
listen very carefully to the stuff Yeltsin and his people are saying
and compare that with the very anti-West slogans coming from his
opponents in the Russian congress.  I sure know who I want to back.

Oh, BTW, Germany has sure come back as a terrible enemy after WWII,
hasn't it?

Better to let them degenerate into civil war?  Remember all those
nuclear weapons in Russia.  I cannot imagine that they would not
be used in a civil war.  If nationialists take over and, even if
they prevent a civil war, most feel they must take back large
parts of land that are in other countries (like Ukraine.)  I also cannot
imagine Ukraine giving up land without a fight, possibly nuclear.

How does this affect us?  Well, we are on the same planet and if
vast tracks of Europe are blown away I think we'd feel something.
A massive breakup of a country that spans 1/6th the planet is
bound to have affects here.  (Of course, there is also the
humanitarian argument that democracies should help other
democracies (or struggling democracies).)


Seriously.  Everyone has different opinions on what is stupid.
My two ""causes"" are aid to Russia and a strong space program.
Someone else will champion welfare or education or doing studies
of drunken goldfish.  That is why we have a republic and not a
true democracy.  Instead of gridlock on a massive scale, we
only have gridlock on a congressional scale.

BTW, who is to decide 'stupid?'  This is just like those who
want to impose their 'morals' on others -- just the sort of
thing I thought Libertarians were against.

Actually, my politics are pretty Libertarian except on this one issue 
and this is why it is impossible for me to join the party.  It seems
that Libertarians want to withdraw from the rest of the world and
let it sink or swim.  We could do that 100 years ago but not now.

As applied to servers, the first three are fuzzy terms.  ""multi-headed""
tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors, sometimes even
multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg,
a Sun with a cg4 display).  ""multi-screen"" and ""multi-display"" would,
if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning
of ""multi-display"" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and
pointers, when it's used it probably refers to the same thing
""multi-screen"" would: a system that provides multiple Screens.

""zaphod"" is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the
pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the
screen.


There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at
most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays
on a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can
be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a
limit of 65535 Displays per machine, but this is not a limitation
inherent to X.

What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular
implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit
of 12 inherent to X, the author of the article had no business writing
about X.

"[Stuff about the connection between IDE and IDA deleated]
If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the 8.3MB/s sighted for IDE come from?

SCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it.
There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and
the software.  THAT IS IT.
Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.

SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}
 asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}
 synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a
 rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}

SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from
 SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs
 this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers
 AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the 
 slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode 
 4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous
 mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}

SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things
 over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the
 machine and the external device.
 Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver
 software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.
 Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.

SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this
 requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING
 devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY
 expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts

The impression I got from talking with Livingston was that the coming
of the Lord, power-wise, is going to be something that those who are
unprepared can't handle -- kinda like overloading a fuse -- due to 
guilt. Somehow it seems to also apply to the entire physical world as 
we know it. LF suggests that God doesn't want that and has sent Koresh 
as a reminder. 

Seems that those who have been purified through salvation, or that those
protected by the Seals, will be the ones who survive. And no -- I don't 
have a good idea yet what ""being shielded by the seals"" actually involves 
or how exactly it relates to salvation. (Other than it involves the
marriage of the Bridegroom and the Bride... for those of you Biblical
well versed.)

Me personally, I'm totally 100% dependent on God through Christ, so 
if God wants me to understand, good. If not, also good. If God wants
to save me, or dispose of me, that's great either way. Being born in
the Spirit, means being part of the Body of Christ (Ephesians 2), so
who and what I was, matters little. * What's important is loving GOD *

Come Nova, Nuke, or Apocalypse -- who cares? Satan might even be able 
to pull off a pretty convincing fake. Big deal. Not worth fearing or 
worrying about though, not before:

Maybe Koresh is right, maybe he isn't, and it should be interesting to 
see the new message (or prophecy). The tour of the Bible I've taken in 
studying the passages he points to in the 3-02 text, has been most re-
warding. But the test of prophecy is still the fruit it bears -- which 
is not yet clear. 

Much much more important is ""Charity"" -- which by definition *is* --

For cites on MSG, look up almost anything by John W. Olney, a
toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on
development.  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an
excitotoxic food additive, and that its major constituent, glutamate
is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain
(humans included).  Too much in the diet, and the system gets thrown

You'll have fun looking for the rear-end gears on an SHO--the Taurus
is a front-wheel-drive vehicle...

I went back and checked the article again; The SHO Wagon is quicker
than the SHO automatic, but significantly slower than the REAL SHO.

Why anyone would order an SHO with an automatic transmission is
beyond me; if you can't handle a stick, you should stick with a
regular Taurus and leave the SHO to real drivers. That is not to
say that there aren't real drivers who can't use the stick (eg
disabled persons), but they aren't in any position to use an
SHO anyway. 

I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic
transmissions from all ""performance-type"" cars (like the 5.0l
Mustangs, Camaros, and the like) we'd cut down on the number of
accidents each year. Autos are fine for sedate little sedans,
but they have no business in performance cars, IMHO.

Stop! Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that 
the first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi 
party, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red
herring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of 
the histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using 
homosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that
Hitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse
official history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts
right. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in
a coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of
homosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it
is possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubt
it - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his
former right hand man was a homosexual?). 

Anyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references 
to the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the 
night of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even 
the Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, 
this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the 
1920's.


Ah, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the
paranoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with 
homosexuality (at least, not according to what I've read), I'd like to know 
what tainted ""evidence"" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made 
by persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those 
accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the 
1920's and 30's, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in 
time and plant ""tainted"" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers 
which were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being 
obvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter
do you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in 
these matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a 
false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point 
here seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof 
falls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework 
before making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.


This is just about the *only* thing we agree on. 

I suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and 
his SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling
seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this
must be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what
lies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this
is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If 
you really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them 
and ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from 
their footnotes? I'm a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and
tracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my
specialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would
cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I'm not going to waste my time
trying to debunk someone's paranoia. Do the research yourself.


Given that you already consider all evidence ""tainted"", what on earth would
constitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been
considered ""shrewd guesses""?

I suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -
historians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious 
footnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually 
provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place 
to start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.

I'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My
apologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent. I forget which gods
are responsible for keeping strings within appropriate newsgroup subject

Must there be a ""why"" to this?  I ask because of what you also

     code"" to perhaps help cure disease of a genetic variation.
     Again, though, must there be ""why"" or a ""divine prupose"" to
     man's existence?


As far as we can tell, man falls into the ""mammal"" catagory.  Now,
     if there were something more to the man (say, a soul), then
     we have yet to find evidence of such.  But as it is now, man
     is a mammal (babies are born live, mother gives milk, we're
     warm-blooded, etc.) as other mammals are and is similar in
     genetic construction to some of them (in particular, primates).

"About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to
be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if
anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published 
solutions to it.

	The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two
roughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially
starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the 
edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant
between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw 
the object we 

1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively
	computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the
        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume
	that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not
	exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable
	measure.
2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment
	of the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two
	triangles which will be filled in to color the surface.
3) Depth sort the triangles
4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw
	and color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is
	along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge
	colored with a special ""edge color""

	It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the
problem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.
The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in
the edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.
They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting
from the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem
sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this
area.",1

An excellent idea.


While I don't know the full scope of the activities of the EFF, 
from what little I've seen I think it would be better to lobby for 
strong cryptography through a distinct organization.

The EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex
and pictures newsgroups at various universities. Horror stories about the
contents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged
models) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletin
already raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only one
step removed from the old ""crypto-wielding child molester"" argument.  An
EFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the
connection to child pornography and the like.

Similarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  In
light of, say, the Gnu Manifesto, this means that in a public debate it
stands to be labelled as ""communist"", ""anarchist hackers"", radical, etc.  

I don't know about CPSR, but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for Social
Responsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hysterical
antinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome political
baggage.

Perhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptography
would best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existing
group, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited to
advocacy for the right to cryptography.  To reiterate Dan Bernstein's
question: does any suitable organization exist?  If not, what are you going
to do about it?

Having mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations,
I would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction:
gathering the support of the NRA by emphasizing the RKBA side of the
issue as well as the First-Amendment side.

No one was ever flogged, beaten, burned, fed to the lions, or killed in any
other way because of a belief in the resurrection - sorry to disappoint you.
The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different
forms in the religions of antiquity.  The problem was not the resurrection
which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population 
(the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  The real problem was
that Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When the
state operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism 
becomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this,
and were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile,
and hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also since
Christians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is
seen by Nero's blaming them for the burning of Rome.  Let's not cloud the
issues with the resurrection.

There is no known writing directly attributable to Menachem Begin
which admits a massacre at Deir Yassin.  Thus, Hasan is wrong.


The word ""troops"" is unjustified.  There has never been any evidence
that there were any regular or irregular Arab forces in the village
apart from the villagers defending themselves.  According to the
Haganah observer Pa'il, the Irgun/Lehi forces suffered a lot of
casualties because they were incompetent soldiers.  When they ran
into trouble securing the central part of the village, a small group 
of Palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty.
Begin's failure to even mention the Palmach is only one of the
major inaccuracies (to use a kind word) in his account.

Incidentally, ""three times as heavy"" may be correct, as there is
serious evidence that the Arab loss was closer to 120 lives than
to the oft-quoted 250 lives.  However, note that Begin compares
wounded Jews to dead Arabs.  He fails to mention the number of
wounded Arabs.  Guess why.


As is thoroughly established by many sources, the loudspeaker truck
got stuck in a ditch too far from the village for it to provide a
usueful warning.


It is worth noting how Begin disputes the standard myth that the
Palestinian Arabs fled as part of a calculated plan.


Apparently 90% of Israeli historians are Jew-haters.

totally destroys Begin's whitewash.  I have no particular desire

The STANDARD AT bus (ISA) runs at 8MHz, not 12.5 MHz, but some 
non-stnadard ISA buses do have higher clock rates, but be careful, since 
some boards don't work with faster than standard rates.  For instance, my 
486 has adjustable AT bus speeds, and my PAS16 audio card chokes when I do 
AD data acquisition with a bus speed faster than 10MHz.

The fact that non-turbo-mode speed A/D doesn't work is weird.  You may 
have a motherboard with a hardware 'bug'.  

33 MHz bus on the 486DX2 66 does refer to the local bus.  FYI: the AT bus 
operates asynchronously, and is linked to the local bus via a 'bus 
interface', which is one function that your 'chipset'.

The problem you see here is that some Christians claim things about
the Bible which they don't actually believe or practice. I've known
all sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to
the fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the 
conservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is
a (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I don't know of anyone
who treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition.
While I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the official
position of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment).

The particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in
terms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact 
that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane 
and give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this 
(other passages as well) aren't directly applicable today would 
show them that what they claim about the Bible and what they 
actually practice are two different things, but mostly it doens't.

While this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians,
I would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this
case, making claims about the Bible which the claimants don't actually
put into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling and
look at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying
to express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the
Christian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as ""Word of
God"", ""inerrant"", ""infallibale"", ""The Manufacturer's Handbook"", ""The
only rule of faith and practice in the church today"" to describe the
Bible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at
the mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably
false and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are
generally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even
when the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical
example is from the garden of Eden where God asks ""Where are you?"" and Adam
explains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had
answered God's words he would have said something like ""I'm here in this
tree."" The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these
words are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most people
have not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of
the place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases
and explanations that others use.

I hope this helps.

OK, you guys stirred up my childhood memories, so I went and did
some research on the final month or so of the 1964 season. It turns
out that my recollections were pretty darn accurate, at least as
far as the Phillies record goes. On September 1 1964 this was the
top of the N.L. standings:

                 W     L    GB
Philadelphia    79    51    -
Cincinnati      74    57    5 1/2
St. Louis       72    59    7 1/2
San Francisco   73    60    7 1/2

This is a game-by-game description of the remainder of the Phillies'
season:

Date  Score Opponent        Lead      Pitcher (starting and winner/loser)
9/1   4-3   Houston         5 1/2     Bunning (15-4)

9/20  3-2   Los Angeles     6 1/2     Bunning (18-5)
            (Reds move back into tie for 2nd with Cardinals)

Well so far so good for the Phillies. But now it all falls apart ...

9/21  0-1   Cincinnati      5 1/2     Mahaffey (12-9)
            (Reds take sole possesion of 2nd place)
9/22  2-9   Cincinnati      4 1/2     Short (17-8)

9/25 5-7/12 Milwaukee       1 1/2     Short; Boozer (3-4)
            (Cards now 2 1/2 back in 3rd, Giants 3 1/2 in 4th)
9/26  4-6   Milwaukee         1/2     Mahaffey; Schantz (2-5)
9/27  8-14  Milwaukee      -1         Bunning (18-7)
            (Phils lose 7 1/2 games in 7 days; Reds take over 1st,
             Cardinals 1 1/2 back in 3rd)
9/28  1-5   St. Louis      -1 1/2     Short(17-9)
            (Cardinals take over 2nd place, Phils drop to 3rd)
9/29  2-4   St. Louis      -1 1/2     Bennett (12-14)
            (Reds and Cardinals now tied for 1st)
9/30  5-8   St. Louis      -2 1/2     Bunning (18-8)
            (Cardinals take 1/2 game lead over Reds)
10/1  4-3   Cincinnati     -1 1/2     Short; Roebuck (5-3)
            (Phillies halt 10-game losing streak; Cards lead Reds by 1/2 game)
10/2  Did not play; Cards lose to Mets, Reds tied for 1st, Phils 1 game back
10/3  10-0  Cincinnati     -1         Bunning (19-8)
            (Cards beat Mets, take first by 1 from Reds and Phillies)

Whew! what a finish! And the final standings were:

                 W     L    GB
St. Louis       93    69    -
Philadelphia    92    70    1
Cincinnati      92    70    1
San Francisco   90    72    3

Now it doesn't appear to me that Phillies pitchers Bunning and Short
were really overused, at least by the four-man rotation standard of
the day, until well along into the 10-game losing streak, at which
time Mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because the
Phillies substantial lead had evaporated. The way they were used at
that time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one
of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of
the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched
a complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It
would be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the
year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league.
Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1
through October 1; while they didn't play substantially more games than
the other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that
stretch.

Charley,

I can't help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers
to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your
previous posts.  I submit that you don't answer them because you
cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic, and I once
again challenge you to prove me wrong.  To make the task as easy for
you as possible, I'll present concise re-statements of some of the
questions that you have failed to answer, in the hope that you may
address them one at a time for all to see.

Should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period, I
will re-post this article, with suitable additions and deletions, at
such time that I notice a post by you on another topic.  I will repeat
this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or
you cease to post to this newsgroup.

I would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these
questions previously and your answer missed my notice.  If you can be
kind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles, I will be only too
pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question, and remove it
from this list.

Now, to the questions...

1. After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological
patterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating
that you weren't referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some
atheists who you feel don't fit your patterns, to show that you indeed
were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failed
to do so.  Please do so now.

Question: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your
stereotype?

Here is the context for the question:



2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that ""senses and
reason are all we have to go by"", and when pressed, you have implied
that we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedly
asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both
experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses
and reason.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.

Question: Can you explain what is revelation and how one can
experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent
reasoning?

Here is the context for the question:

3.  You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by
a.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical.  I asked you to identify
one such claim that I have made.  You have failed to do so.  Please do
so now.

Question: Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and
fantastical?  If so, please repeat them.

Here is the context for the question:



then later...



4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as
a result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the
""axioms"" of reason that one couldn't help but become atheist.  I asked
you to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement
that the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that
I have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer
the question.  Please do so now.

Question: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become
atheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that
effect?  If you don't retract that claim, do you retract the
subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably
result in atheism?

Here is the context for the question:

5.  First, you claimed that you would (probably) not answer these
Challenges because they contained too much in the way of ""included
text"" from previous posts.  Later, you implied that you wouldn't
respond because I was putting words in your mouth.  Please clarify
this seeming contradiction.

Question:  Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context
from your own posts, or that I paraphrase your positions in order to
avoid ""included text""?

"Well, the tentative rules, anyway.  And, of course, since the season is
not entirely over, tentative entry form.  But who cares?  The real hockey
season is starting!!!!!

Here's the deal:  You email (preferably) or post your predictions, AND the
number of games you think each series will go.  Each round will be
weighted, so that the Stanley Cup finals will be very important, but the
early rounds will still be important.  Here is the scoring:

Pick 1st round winner, way off on games:  2 points
Pick 1st round winner, within one game:   3 points
Pick 1st round winner, pick # of games:   5 points

Pick 2nd round winner, way off on games:  3 points
Pick 2nd round winner, within one game:   4 points
Pick 2nd round winner, pick # of games:   6 points

Pick conference champ, way off on games:  5 points
Pick conference champ, within one game:   6 points
Pick conference champ, pick # of games:   9 points

Pick Stanley Cup champ, way off on games: 8 points
Pick Stanley Cup champ, within one game:  10 points
Pick Stanley Cup champ, pick # of games:  14 points
Pick loser in 7, series goes 7:           2 points
Pick loser in 7, series decided in Game 7, OT: 4 points
(these last two are sympathy points, probably won't happen anyway)

Obviously, picking the Stanley Cup champion is important.  I will do some
tests to see if the format is fair, but probably I will be too lazy to
modify it, so the scoring will probably be like this.  As for entry forms,
well, this post is getting too long, so see next post.

soldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in
favor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, they
massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing
to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their
very lives.

Taking into account the intifadah of the Palestinian people in the
occupied Palestinian territory against the Israeli occupation,
including Israeli economic and social policies and practices,

Rejecting Israeli restrictions on external economic and social
assistance to the Palestinian people in the occupied Palestinian
territory,

Concerned about the economic losses of the Palestinian people as a

Legal or not, I've seen it done.  Phone records were obtained
in order to *establish* probable cause, rather than as a result of it.
In other words, for a fishing expedition.

 

And does the phone company require written, subpoena-able evidence
of probable cause in order to process the request?  I suggest that
the officer was disinterested in pursuing your case -- even if you
could prove the offender had called you at a certain time, your 
chances of winning a harassment suit on the strength of this evidence
are nil.  My contact with several people who have dealt with cases
of extreme phone harassment (several thousand calls in one case) teaches 
me that police in this area are quite lethargic about pursuing such matters.

Hmm.  I beg to differ.  It will probably make a big difference at some

Thankfully, it is true that the majority go through life without
having to use a firearm.  Howver, there are situations where firearms
are the most effective means of self protection.  What other means do
you propose as equally effective?



New to this country? New to political theory?
Alas, I was speaking of principle.  Without principle, all attempts at
republican forms of gov't are futile.  There are times when public and
political opinion are contrary to principle, which is why we have a
Constitution which enumerates gov't powers and presumes certain
rights.  A major reason for this was to prevent a tyranny of the
majority.


This is exactly why law should be based on reasoned thought, not
immediate perception.  Of course, it doesn't always work that way.
Fortunately, while there are no guarantees, logic sometimes does
prevail.  And, if not, there are still means for correction.  
As far as ""enough active voters"" are concerned, that is still
an open question until the vote is made.


You portray a possible scenario for the future.  But, how will you
silence RKBA supporters right now?  As long as public debate is
allowed, such debate will continue. If we allow public debate to be
restricted or denied, then we will get a gov't we deserve.",16

Isn't is funny how someone who seems to know nothing about homosexuality 
uses a very flawed (IMHO) source of information to pass jusgement on all

the heterosexual group of men is larger then the chances of promiscuity 
larger as well.  In my opinion, orientation has nothing to do with it.

Men are men and they all like sex.  I am a gay male.  I have had sex three 
times in my life, all with the same man.  Before that, I was a virgin.

So... whose promiscuous?

Just because someone is gay doesn't mean they have no morals.  Just because 
someone is heterosexual doesn't mean they do.  Look at the world....  
Statistics alone prove that most criminals are by default hetero...

The best info I have seen so far is the article ""Joystick Metrics:

Michael Covington in the May 1985 issue of PC Tech Journal.  It talks
about how to read all kinds of things (voltage, current, resistance) in
BASIC, and even includes code for a simple ""oscilloscope"" display.

It's possible to read the joystick port directly if you don't want to
use BASIC.  The detailed information for this is in the PC Technical
Reference under Options and Adapters.  You have to provide some
millisecond resolution timing functions, but that's a subject which has
appeared many times in articles from Dr. Dobb's, Circuit Cellar Ink,

[...]

   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION
   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What
   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.

   [Reproduced without permission]

	   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,
	where a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under
	the tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,
	presumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if
	a person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group
	of 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and
	sugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after
	drinking the artificially sweetened beverage.
	   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a
	good deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.
	However, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers
	did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did
	actually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not
	necessarily go hand in hand.
	   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining
	the effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.
	And after reviewing every one of them, the director of the
	Laboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins
	University, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-
	sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in
	the amount of food eaten afterward.

	   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing
	cancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a
	host of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government
	has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing
	everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.
	Still, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and
	after the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm
	that it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the
	Centers for Disease Control (the government agency charged with
	monitoring public health), the American Medical Association's
	Council on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration
	have given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a
	clean bill of health.
	   Granted, the FDA has set forth an ""acceptable daily intake"" of
	50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed
	the limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take
	in 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of
	aspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,
	or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...
	A 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams
	of the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups
	of yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content
	of selected foods omitted]
	   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away
	from aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called
	phenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000
	to 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential
	amino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child
	consumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause
	such severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with
	PKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other
	aspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning ""Phenylketonurics:
	Contains Phenylalanine.""

I'm not aware that the US government considers me dangerous.  In any
case, that has nothing to do with the current case.  The claim against
the ADL is that it illegally obtained and disseminated information that
was gathered by state and/or federal agencies in the course of their
standard interaction with citizens such as myself.  By that I refer to
things such as: address and phone number, vehicle registration and
license information, photographs, etc.


You should ask the ADL, if you want an authoritative answer.  My guess
is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in
political criticism of Israel.  I further believe that they did this as
agents of the Israeli government, or at least in agreement with them.
At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to
Israeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence, or attempt
to influence, people's access to jobs or public forums.  These matters
will be brought out as the court case unfolds, since California law
entitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven.  As my
previous posting shows, California law entitles people to compensation
even in the absence of any specific consequences -- just for the further
dissemination of certain types of private information about them.",17

"I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure
events are handled.

I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the
capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be
resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events.
The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event
calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a ""fake"" Expose
event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct)
to draw the data.

Quest 1.
When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.)
I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size
is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right?
Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?

Quest 2.
When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events
whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

"Hi Damon,  No matter what system or explanation of creation you wish
to accept, you always have to start with one of two premises, creation
from nothing, or creation from something.  There are no other
alternatives.  And if we accept one or the other of those two
premises, then again there are two alternatives, either creation was
random, or was according to some plan.
   If it was random, I am unable to accept that the complex nature of
our world with interrelated interdependent organisms and creatures
could exist as they do.  Therefore I am left with creation under the
control of an intelligence capable of devising such a scheme.  I call
that intelligence God.
   I also prefer the ""Creatio ex nihilo"" rather than from chaos, as it
is cleaner.
   There is obviously no way to prove either or neither.  We are and
we must have come from somewhere.  Choose whatever explanation you

Is this an advantage to MS Windows or to Xt?  I used to think it
was a big advantage for Xt, but I am not at all sure anymore...

I have been in the same boat as you last year. I've tried four times to
send you an email response, but your end doesn't seem to accept my mail?
Please let me know if you receive this.

Well, there are two approaches we can take here.  One is to ask you what this
objective morality is, assuming it's not a secret.

The other is to ask you what you think is wrong with relativism, so that we
can correct your misconceptions :-)

The FBI and Koresh were calling the shots.  And there were very sane reasons  
for keeping the children, if they let them go, the parents would NEVER see them  
again.  That is not an easy choice, in spite of you cold attitude about it.


I am a constitution worshiper.  You quite obviously eat anything the  
authorities feed you, without doubt, which makes you no different that a Koresh  
worshiper

you  
If you do not believe this, you are truly naive.  It is not only possible, it  
is easy.  I worked in the broadcast profession, at a network station, in the  
late 70s, I know what I'm saying here.  Embarrasing footage is easy to get, add  
a little sinister music, and the right voice-over, and I'll have you mother  
agreeing to commit you.

The news shows were looking for excerpts which backed their position.  Do you  
think they would show excerpts which disproved their points?

The reports of multi-starts came solely from the FBI.  Anyone observing the  
fire from the available video would be hard pressed to see more than one point  
of fire.  Which spread across the compound as a uniform rate.

it  

No reported has ever sued the government for such a situation.  They know the  
dangers.  Remember, the BATF invited the initial coverage. And how about a  
simple, remote-controlled, camera or two?  There were ways to provide media  
access.  The FBI obviously just didn't want any.

I can find several.  Tear gas and smoke making it impossible to remove the  
barricades.  Flames blocking exits to the saferooms. Perhaps the gun shots were  
from the FBI, keeping them pinned in?  Who knows?

Gregg, I'm really sorry if having it pointed out that in practice
things aren't quite the wonderful utopia you folks seem to claim
them to be upsets you, but exactly who is being childish here is 
open to question.

BBCI was an example of an Islamically owned and operated bank -
what will someone bet me they weren't ""real"" Islamic owners and
operators? - and yet it actually turned out to be a long-running
and quite ruthless operation to steal money from small and often
quite naive depositors.

And why did these naive depositors put their life savings into
BCCI rather than the nasty interest-motivated western bank down
the street?   Could it be that they believed an Islamically owned 
and operated bank couldn't possibly cheat them? 

So please don't try to con us into thinking that it will all 
work out right next time.",0

For some reason the following code causes my X application to beep whenever I
intercept a keystroke and change it's meaning.  The intent of this code it to
allow ""date"" fields the following special keys:

	[Tt]:	Insert today's date
	[+=]:	Bump day up by one
	[-_]:	Bump day down by one

I hardcoded some dates for this example.  Perhaps I shouldn't be using an
XmText field for this.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
// 
// For some reason the following code beeps whenever any of the special keys
// of [Tt+=-_] are hit.  Why?  The idea of this code is to interpret these
// keys having the special meaning implied by the code.  I would like to get
// rid of the beeping but, as far as I can tell, I'm not doing the beep and 
// am at a lose as to understanding who and why the beeping is occuring.

Some people pay shares that are more ""fair"" than others, and will continue
to do so, even with the presence of President Clinton.  Until the rich 
elite *hurt* from taxes and shower me with their blood dripping from the
wound of the tax dagger, I will scream and yell.  Because, taxes are 
killing the poor and middle-class, and I'm tired of the wealthy getting
a free ride in this country.  Sure, they pay a lot of taxes, but I want
them to SHARE MY PAIN!!

And, not even Slick Willy is *that* fair, is he, seeing that he and his
wife qualify as one of those wealthy people I was talking about?  [They're
on the lower end of ""wealthy"", but ""wealthy"" they are.]


Yah, I think the draft for Vietnam was a sack of shit.  But, do we get
to pick and choose which laws we obey, Mr. Chaudhary?  If so, shall we
set up a ""you follow the laws you like, and I'll follow the laws I 
like"" arrangement?


I never thought much of beaded curtains.
 
Now beaded seat-covers, on the other hand....


I didn't think I was going to respond to this, but I changed my mind.

Tell me, why do you think health care is a human right?  

This isn't a flame or anything, I just wonder.  Next thing you know, 
free public transportation will be a human right.  Maybe membership

The same way that any theory is proven false.  You examine the predicitions

observe things that the theory predicts wouldn't happen, then you have some 
evidence against the theory.  If the theory can't be modified to 
incorporate the new observations, then you say that it is false.

There's a lot of evidence, it just hasn't been adequately gathered and
published in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptics
who quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is used.

For example, Dr. Ivker, who wrote the book ""Sinus Survival"", always gives,
before any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to his
new patients IF they've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times
in the last two years.  He's kept a record of the results, and for over 
2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief
of allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his
program.

In my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic
symptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' (I agree it is a poorly 
written book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which
I never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage
of Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can
now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I'm also
*greatly* improved in other areas as well.

Of course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to
molds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that
if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a
natural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you
would have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various
sorts, and again, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that
such toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus
since that's the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000
question is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was
from over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the
stress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast
colonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since
testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to
take an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively
safe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there's
no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.

BTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae
too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You'll find
a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.

In summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep
medicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly
to the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough
actually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to my
face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection', I cannot guarantee
their safety.  For their incompetence, ripping off their lips is justified as
far as I am concerned.

"The people who post to this particular newsgroup are either too cowardly,
too arrogant, or too apathetic to discuss this issue since I have yet to
see any discussion grace my computer screen.  While it holds PARTICULAR
interest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain
from discussing it.  As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity
has been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental
hold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans. 
This was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in
slave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners.  It
wasn't enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your
GOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be
worshipped with great pride.  But how culturally & biblically accurate are
these icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in
European countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical
physical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool,
His feet to that of brass?  And think about the area of the world where all
Biblical actions took place.  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this

"As the subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me GPF) on me of  
late.  It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every  
day.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I  
can't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same  
application. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  
that caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I  
need to re-boot.

Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I  
first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many  
GPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows  
(with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge  
machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into  
the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  
the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I  
was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  
board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  
SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  
fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.

The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  
rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves  
the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't. 

I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said  
these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire  
day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's  
in the sppace of 20 minutes?

What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good  
diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software  
problem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After  
Dark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or  
gdi.exe.

Any help is truly appreciated.....

Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm afraid your friendship is in danger.  
Perhaps you should examine in yourself why as such a good friend, you 
are unwilling to accept this imortant part of your friends life?  Why 
do you call into question his faith?  Your friend has changed, he has 
found something that fills a need in his life.  You need to decide if 
you are still his friend, whether you can accommodate his new life.  
It sounds as if you are criticizing him for a fundamental belief in 
the Bible, yet you are quick to reveal that your fundamental belief 
that it is superstition.  Perhaps if he knew you at least took him 
seriously, that you at least took an interest in the light he has found, 
that you at least tried to understand what has become a special part of 
his life, you could together decide to become fundamentalists, respect 
each others differences and remain friends, or part ways.  Maybe even if 
you stuck it out with him, you could help him to un-convert.  Of course, 
if you go in with that attitude he will surely see through your intentions 
and begin to resent you.

I happen to be a person very tolerant of fundamentalists, because I know
that the idea of a simple black and white approach to life is appealing.
I don't happen to share the beliefs of fundamentalists, but I am not
offended by their prosyletizing.  I had a few good conversations with
some Witnesses who came to my door.  I didn't switch my beliefs, but for
those at home who maybe need a friendly face to invite them somewhere,
the Witnesses provide a wonderful service.  You may have been conditioned
to believe that religion is unimportant and witnessing is obnoxious, but
why?  Are you afraid you might be converted and become one of them, that
you will be swept up in fundamentalism, that you will become a weirdo.
Friendship's a two-way street.  You must respect your friend, ALL of him,
including his beliefs, if you want the friendship to continue.",15

I attended a colloquium at Goddard last fall where the head of the 
operations section of NASA was talking about what future missions
were going to be funded.  I don't remember his name or title off hand
and I have discarded the colloquia announcement. In any case, he was 
asked about that very matter: ""Why can't we spend a few million more
to keep instruments that we already have in place going?""

His responce was that there are only so many $ available to him and
the lead time on an instrument like a COBE, Magellan, Hubble, etc
is 5-10 years minumum.  If he spent all that could be spent on using
current instruments in the current budget enviroment he would have
very little to nothing for future projects.  If he did that, sure
in the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular,
however starting a few years after he had retired he would become
one of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for not
funding the early stages of the next generation of instruments.  Just
as he had benefited from his predicessor's funding choices, he owed it
to whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing new
missions, even at the expense of cutting off some instruments before
the last drop of possible science has been wrung out of them.

Here at Lewis and Clark College we have recently installed a Digital Film
system (based on the Mac Quadra) that does non-linear, full digital editing.

If you're considering such a system, here are the pros and cons:

For the educational environment, this system is excellent.  We use it to
produce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local
network.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the
image quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the
video to the Net.

We also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for
use by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for
commercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.

The Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll
digitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as
an inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker
of the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been
unable to deliver.  Our system produces ""near VHS"" quality at 30 fields per
second (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60
fields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some
find distracting.

If you can get past this problem, you'll find the Adobe Premier editing 
software quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of
different effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.

Because of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you've ever
used (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you'll recognize the methodology
and the user interface.

The total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21"" Apple mon-
itor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),
Composite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.

For you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality
that will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more
effects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system
will look better.

We use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.  Each for what each does best!

Is there any Israeli a civilian, in your opinion ?

Now, I do not condone myself bombing villages, any kind of villages.
But you claim these are villages with civilians, and Iraelis claim they are 
camps filled with terrorists. You claim that israelis shell the villages with the
'hope' of finding a terrorist or so. If they kill one, fine, if not, too bad, 
civilians die, right ? I am not so sure. 

As somebody wrote, Saddam Hussein had no problems using civilians in disgusting
manner. And he also claimed 'civilians murdered'. Let me ask you, isn't there 
at least a slight chance that you (not only, and the question is very general, 
no insult) are doing a similar type of propaganda in respect to civilians in
southern Lebanon ?

Now, a lot people who post here consider 'Israeli soil' kind of Mediteranean sea.
How do you define Israeli soil ? From what you say, if you do not clearly 
recognize the state of Israel, you condone killing israelis anywhere.


I do not know what was the pupose of the action you describe. If it was 
to kill civilians (I doubt), I certainly DO NOT CONDONE IT. If civilians were 
killed, i do not condone it. 





Mr. Hernlem, it was YOU, not ME, who was showing a huge satisfaction for 3 
israelis (human beings by most standards, Don't know about your standards) killed.

If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a 
question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing
justifies murder. I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make
similar statements, maybe after eliminating all Israelis, jews, ? Am I wrong ?


Now tell me, did you also condone Saddam's scuds on israeli 'soldiers' in, let's
say, Tel Aviv ? From what I understand, a lot of palestineans cheered. What does
it show? It does not qualify for freedom fighting to me ? But again, I may be 
wrong, and the jewish controlled media distorted the information, and I am just
an ignorant victim of the media, like most of us.

of what the GUI users are doing, not about what they actually *are* doing.
This abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer*
of the system. (NB: some users may see it, too, but only when they put
aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.)

I'm not saying that the programmer's perspective is evil or stunted. After
all, that's what I do, too! I am saying that UI designers must carefully
distinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models, and they must
ultimately serve the user of the system, not the builder of the system. 


   I don't recall the actual stats, but something like 1 in 5 people can be
   categorized as a ""symbol manipulator"".

It would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this
claim. At any rate, I don't think this is evidence that 20% of users think
like programmers. Bankers, financial analysts, structural engineers ---
these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol
manipulation. But what they do is not programming, and programming is not
required to do what they do. ",5
"I have a 486DX33 ISA system with 4 meg.  I am using a Diamond Speedstar HiColor
video card with 1 meg VRAM and a standard CTX 14-in SVGA monitor.  When I am
running Windows, and I have overlapping windows (say an application overlapping
the program manager window), and I close the active application, window erasure
is very slow.  The part of the window that is not overlapping is erased first,
very slowly.  This also happens when I iconify an application.

The HiColor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card, but it
does not have an accelerator chip on it.  I am running at 800x600x32k.  Is this
slow speed simply to be expected without an accelerator chip, or is there
something else that is bottlenecking the system that I am unaware of?

"Hi Xperts,

this is a repost (no one responded to my desperate yell 8-(
I can't believe there is no XView wizards any more 8-)...

I'm using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric
field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field.
In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters,
in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by 
PANEL_MAX_VALUE! 

As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls
number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't
work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h>
contains the following bit:

	/* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item,
	 * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes
	 */
	PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,			 152),
	PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,		 182),

which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders.
But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting
this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and returns value 0.

Strange thing is that DEC's port of XView gives plenty of space
in a text fields, but not Sun's Xview...

Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me,
and clear this problem? 

Any help is very much appreciated.

The following is extracted from sumex-aim.stanford.edu.  It should also be on
the mirrors.  I think there is source for some applications that may have some
bearing on your project.  Poke around the source directory.  I've never used
this package, nor do I know anyone who did, but the price is right :-)

Hope this helps.

Subject: 3d GrafSys 1.21 in incoming directory
A 3d GrafSys short description follows:

Programmers 3D GrafSys Vers 1.21 now available. 

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users. THIS VERSION
NOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for
C programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free 
to contact me.
The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from
the FPU version to make it run faster.

Those of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.

********

Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:
-------------------------------------

Didn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of 
drawing three-dimensional scenes? 

Didn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure 
of three-dimensional molecules?

And didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from 
actually doing it?

Well if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to 
do with this package???' , read on.

GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines 
for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating 
(independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) 
three dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.

GrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-
line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.

GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel
projections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing
off for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain
what it all means later on). 

GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with
data so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines
to do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so
you don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)

GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above 
processors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.
Both versions are *100% source compatibel*. 

GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D
graphics and how to use the package.

If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. 
However, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for
a lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.

GrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage. Read the documentation enclosed.

I think the other replies sum up the fact that you can place a hard drive
on its side.  The point is this will only be sure to work on the 'new'
drives, namely 1/3 ht LPS drives that have a smaller platter and are also
more stable.
	Why should I take the chance?  Because I've been running a Maxtor 1/3 ht
120 LPS on both its side and flat for about a year and I've had no
problems with it.  Period.
	Like I always say, NEVER trust the manufacturer.

------------ begin my response -----------------
[...]

Maybe because the claims deserve refute?  The above abstract lists various
possible links to cannabis use (unfiltered almost guaranteed) and lung
problems.  Someone may get overly excited when they see that article, but 
without actually digging up the study and seeing how the studies gathered 
their data it really doesn't tell you shit.  I'm going to track down that
study hopefully tomarrow.

[...]


What justifies _the_ truth about drugs?  Research?  What sort of 
research?  Correlational data can help establish a theory, but it does not
prove anything.


Heroin _is_ a relatively safe drug.  What makes it unsafe are IV administration
and shit like adulterants.  There are side effects, like withdrawal, but they
effect people differently.  


Stereotypical statement.  I know people who use heroin and opiates that 
function just fine in society.  


Name some of these drugs so we can debate about them more specifically.

[...]

NO, NO, NO.  (or at least I haven't been arguing this).  there is not enough
data to form a scientific conclusion.  that _doesn't_ mean that cannabis
is benign to users' lungs.  we can form all the theories we want, but they
are only theories.  some theories are supported by more evidence than others,
and that makes them stronger.  


the hell I can't!  they state *UN-JUSTIFIED CONCLUSIONS* *AS FACT* as
a *POLITICAL* strategy to stop drug use.

[...]

In general, I somewhat see what you're saying.  And people like Jack Herer
contribute to this.  This has been quite a big mind-fuck for me recently,
and I've pretty came to the conclusion that you can't trust _ANYBODY_ by
word of mouth alone -- my attitude about the general population has
decreased significantly.  

gotta run to class..

			How do I get a DoD number?

If the most Frequently Asked Question in rec.motorcycles is ""What is the
DoD?"", then the second most Frequently Asked Question must be ""How do I
get a DoD number?"" That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List
(KotL, accept no substitue Keepers) for a number. If you're feeling
creative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can
make a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-
base-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not
that you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)

Oh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You'll
just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole
net, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.

By now you're probably asking ""So who's the KotL already?"". Well, as
John Sloan notes below, that's about the only real ""secret"" left around
here, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,
nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was
the original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the
KotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely
with hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-
oriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting
messages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with ""weenie
mailers""). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a
Dead-Head.

***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************

Once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically
groveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed
work for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting
something done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)
days, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of
economic activity on the part of the KotL's employers, sending yet
another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it
just makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an
excersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least
annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request
was submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think
the KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).

***********************************************************************

One more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what
they used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?
The typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &
e-mail address. For example:

0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM

(PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only
requirements for DoD membership, that's not strictly true these days, as
there are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)

            ""Denizens of Doom"", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)

      [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce's permission]

There is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal 
things that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and  
motorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  
helmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve
seats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, 
traffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double 
entendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They 
argue with each other and plan rides together.

The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, 
although they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each 
other face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world 
and communicate with each other electronically via computer.

The computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  
the people range from college and university students to high-tech industry 
professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, 
rec.motorcycles (pronounced ""wreck-dot-motorcycles,"" it's the file name for 
the group's primary on-line ""meeting place"") carries about 2250 articles per 
month;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent 
posters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred 
to as the DoD.

The DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of 
parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer 
enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, ""Denizen 
of Doom.""  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of 
the Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of 
course, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.

The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules 
appealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the 
List, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been 
almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and 
Canada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, 
Germany, Norway and Finland.

Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run 
of 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the 
American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- 
selling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a 
few months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were 
donated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 
to the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs 
in the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.

As often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go 
riding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of 
DoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's 
""Silicon Valley.""  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on 
Rollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California 
""Joust.""

The Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big 
barbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern 
California ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, 
meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan 
for 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction 
with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.

Though it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective 
communications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional 
motorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in 
search of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to 
get together.  Long may they flame.


""Live to Flame -- Flame to Live""	[centerbar]

This official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which 
you can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do 
anything like that face to face.  These insults are known as ""flames"";  
issuing them is called ""flaming.""  Flames often start when a member 
disagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A 
typical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be 
something like:  ""What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad 
poseur!""  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense 
of the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding 
ability and your cat.

          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_

                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011

Periodically the question ""What is DoD?"" is raised. This is one of
those questions in the same class as ""Why is the sky blue?"", ""If there
is a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?"" and ""Why do
women inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they
dump you?"", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,
and philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion
by philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the
halls of academe for generations. 

A long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few
minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on
a computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two
machines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another
via a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but
who was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of
the various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and
signed it ""The Denizen of Doom"". Not wishing to identify himself, he
asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time
become DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit
about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking
individual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. 

He who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was
the funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty
easily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom
Motorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership
number. 

Perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a
motorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or
make or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized
electronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a
part of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a
gestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the
sum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds who
wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen
to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight
ratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open
minded enough to accept us as members. 

In a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom
Motorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have
never met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet
feel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some
of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized
and run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the
network via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list
(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the
same region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating
around the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by
#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and
distributed on VHS by #18)! 

Where will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,
placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine
management computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each
participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?
Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal
room and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. 

The DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net
access and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only
ask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few
really good club secrets). New members will receive via email a
membership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which
includes name, state, and email address. 

The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least
until next year when we may decided to change the name).

                      The DoD

              by the Denizen of Doom    DoD #1
 
Welcome one and all to the flamingest, most wonderfullest newsgroup of
all time: wreck.mudder-disciples or is it reak.mudder-disciples? The
Names have been changes to protect the Guilty (riders) and Innocent
(the bikes) alike. If you think you recognize a contorted version of
your name, you don't. It's just your guilt complex working against
you. Read 'em and weep. 

We tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. Terrible
Barbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane to
Reverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection: 

Terrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!! 

Muck: I don't mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW
     crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer
     11 but what the heck.  

Stompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that's all man.

Terrible: Nahhhh, you're sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at
     least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor!
     Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a
     Woosh-a-stream.

Stompin: You mean Wee-Stream.

Terrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements???

Stompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let's see
     what they say, eh? 

Muck: Now men, let's try to be civil about this.

High Tech: Hi, I'm a 9 and the BMW is the greatest.

Arlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW!

Terrible: B.T.???

Arlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.

Muck: Ahhh, look, you're making Terrible gag.

Terrible: What does BMW stand for anyway??? 

Muck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.

Terrible: Actually, my name is Terrible. Hmmm, I don't know either.

Muck: Say, here comes Chunky Bear.

Chunky: Hey, Hey, Hey! Smarter than your average bear!

Terrible: Hey, didn't you drop your BMW???

Chunky: All right eh, a little BooBoo, but I left him behind. I mean 
     even Villy Ogle flamed me for that! 

Muck: It's okay, we all makes mistakes.

Out of the blue the West coasters arrive, led by Tread Orange with
Dill Snorkssy, Heritick Ratatnack, Buck Garnish, Snob Rasseller and
the perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush! 

Heritick: Heya Terrible, how's yer front to back bias?

Terrible: Not bad, sold yer BMW?

Heritick: Nahhh.

Hooter: Hoot, Hoot.

Buck: Nice tree Hooter, how'd ya get up there?

Hooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!!

Muck: What's a carbujector?

Hooter: Well, it ain't made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!!

Muck: Ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!!

Dill: Well, where do we race?

Snob: You know, Chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't
     ride! 

Muck: No! No! Quiet!

Tread: BMW's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion.
     They even have luggage made by Sourkraut!

High: My 9 too!

Terrible, Heritick, Dill, Buck: Nahhhhh!!!

Stompin, Tread, High, Chunky, Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!!

Before this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up more
cohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and the
infamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin! 

Polyanna: Well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like
     I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting
     it up on the ole ventral stand!  

Terrible: Hopalonga's are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka's and
     Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too! 

Booster: I hate Cavortin.

All: WE KNOW, WE KNOW.

Booster: I love Cavortin.

All: WE KNOW WE KNOW.

Muck: Well, what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras?

Snob, Tread: Nawwwwww.

Muck: What about a Tridump?

Terrible: Isn't that a chewing gum?

Muck: Auggggg, Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity?

Heritick: Heyya Muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself?

Muck: No, no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make.

Two more riders zoom in, in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter.
Pill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.

Phalanx: Hey, I don't know about that.

And Now even more west coasters pour in.
Road O'Noblin: Hopalonga's are the greatest!

Maulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector!

Suddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth:
Kite Lanolin: Hey, BMW's are great, men.

Robo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.

More riders from the west coast come into the discussion:
Aviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.

Guess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison.

With a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. It
was none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn. 
Clean: Like look, Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns. 

Muck: Why??

Clean: Well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.

Muck: But I only have a 4-banger.

Clean: No GOOD!

Chunky: Sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!

Clean: Inferior!

Stompin: Hey, look, here's proof BMW's are better. The Bimmer-Boys
burst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe, Beemer Babe give me a
thrill... 

Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for? 

Heritick, Stompin, Snob, Chunky, Tread, Kite, High, Arlow: BEAT'S ME,
     WILHEM! 

Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Oh, don't you mean BMW? 

And so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the
thunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them all
boomed out.
G.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding
     Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions. 

All: no, No, NO!!! Puhlease.

Does this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding
mini-trikes?  Are our arguing heros doomed?  Tune in next week for the
next gut wretching episode of ""The Yearning and Riderless"" with its
ever increasing cast of characters.  Where all technical problems will
be flamed over until well done.  Next week's episode will answer the
question of: ""To Helmet or Not to Helmet"" will be aired, this is heady
material and viewer discretion is advised.

          Script for the Denizens of Doom Anthem Video

                by Jonathan E. Quist   DoD #94


[Scene:  A sterile engineering office.  A lone figure, whom we'll call
Chuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white CDC lab coat,
with 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.] 

(editor's note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at
the First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizens
referring to each other as ""Chuck"". I guess you had to be there. I
wasn't.) 

Chuck:  I didn't want to be a Software Systems Analyst,
 cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir,
 may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted
 to live a man's life,
[Music slowly builds in background]
 riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes
 and the deepest valleys,
 living the life of a Motorcyclist;
 doing donuts and evading the police;
 terrorizing old ladies and raping small children;
 eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  In short,

	I Want to be      A Denizen!

[Chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with
fringe), boots, and cap.  Scene simultaneously changes to the top of
an obviously assaulted Rollins Pass.  A small throng of Hell's Angels
sit on their Harleys in the near background, gunning their engines,
showering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oil
on the tarmac.  Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat
Boy.] 

Chuck [Sings to the tune of ""The Lumberjack Song""]:

I'm a Denizen and I'm okay,
I flame all night and I ride all day.

[Hell's Angels Echo Chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]:
He's a Denizen and he's okay,
He flames all night and he rides all day.

I ride my bike;
I eat my lunch;
I go to the lavat'ry.
On Wednesdays I ride Skyline,
Running children down with glee.

[Chorus]:
He rides his bike;
He eats his lunch;
He goes to the lavat'ry.
On Wednesdays he rides Skyline,
Running children down with glee.

[Chorus refrain]:
'Cause He's a Denizen...

I ride real fast,
My name is Chuck,
It somehow seems to fit.
I over-rate the worst bad f*ck,
But like a real good sh*t.

Oh, I'm a Denizen and I'm okay!
I flame all night and I ride all day.

[Chorus refrain]:
Oh, He's a Denizen...

I wear high heels
And bright pink shorts,
 full leathers and a bra.
I wish I rode a Harley,
 just like my dear mama.

[Chorus refrain]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    Why you have to be killed.

Well, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed
to read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD started
as a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.

Sometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: ""What does DoD
stand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it?"" Naturally, a
Denizen who had watched the movie ""Top Gun"" a few times too many rose
to the occasion and replied:

""That's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you.""

And the rest is history.

A variation on the ""security"" theme is to supply disinformation about
what DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where
known) include:

Daughters of Democracy (DoD 23)		Doers of Donuts
Dancers of Despair (DoD 9)		Debasers of Daughters
Dickweeds of Denver			Driveway of Death
Debauchers of Donuts			Dumpers of Dirtbikes

Note that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be
limited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                     The rec.moto.photo archive

First a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck
Rogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,
and several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in
unknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate
for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not
only provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken
the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.

Not only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk
at their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the
server too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,
the general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.

Here are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how
to use the archive.

**********************************************************

Via ftp:

cerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]

Via e-mail:

The address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the
message.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The
arguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For
rec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:

dir [dod]
send [dod]bruce_tanner.gif
send [dod]dodframe.ps

and you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts
of bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.

Oh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to
the next whole file) are send.  A 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of
50K each; not a good idea.

Cerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner

**********************************************************

A couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so
why not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?
Second, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind
of you to access it after normal working hours (California time). 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      Patches? What patches?

You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &
pins. And your reaction was probably: ""I want!"", or ""That's sick!"", or
perhaps ""That's sick! I want!""

Well, there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that
there's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad
news is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn't
because of any ""exclusivity"" attempt, but simply because there is no
""DoD store"" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by
individual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is
someone says ""I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they'll cost
$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?"" Then
orders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the
pre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a
DoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or
produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all
this is anarchy in action.

Here's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and
perpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),
motorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts
(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and
patches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by
popular demand].

All ""profits"" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association
Motorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been
contributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,
you'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of ""Denizens
of Doom, USENET, The World"", complete with a DoD pin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.

~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles
~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>
~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum
~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT

I received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,
the other day.

""Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:

Congratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the
Denizens of Doom!  With your recent donation, the total amount donated is
now $5,500.  On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitude
to all the membership of the Denizens.  The club's new plaque is presently
being prepared.  Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to 
see the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.  By the way,
I will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque.  Again, thank 
you for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, the
museum, and the fulfillment of its goals.

                                Sincerely,


                                Jim Rogers, D.O.D. #0395
                                Director

P.S.  Please post on your computer bulletin board.""

As you all know, even though the letter was addressed to me personally,
it was meant for all of you who purchased DoD goodies that made this
amount possible.

                        Organized (?) Rides:

Summer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third
year, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass
trip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got
together for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north
as NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of
North Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great
Pacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for
riding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have
come to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]

Also worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the
Moab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up,
riding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal
2-strokes.  And though it's not an ""official"" (as if anything could be
official with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races
in Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters
to gather.  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah.
European Denizens have staged some gathers too.  (Your ad here,
reasonable rates!)

"Obesssive Compulsive Disorder (not to be confused with Obsessive Compulsive
_Personality_ Disorder !) is an acute anxiety disorder characterized by
either obsessions (persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety when
not entertained), or compulsions (repetitive, ritualistic actions that
similarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted).  

OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression.  

Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved
one (though not accompanied by anger), or a religious person having 
recurrent blasphemous thoughts.  Generally, the individual attempts to ignore
or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities.  
The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, rather
than being from an external source.

Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing,
or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a
source of the anxiety.

In OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the
individual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair their
daily routine and social relationships.

Treatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimes
certain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating
obsessions and compulsions.

The standard diagnostic code for OCD, if you want to look it up in the
DSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 .

Brake rotors and the clutch are the main things.  There has been a clutch 
replacement program; you might check to see if the car is still eligible, 
as it is a change well worth making.  You can also swap the cruddy cable 
shifter for the newer rod shifter, also a change worth making, but that'll 
cost you some $$.

My brakes usually do one wibble-wobble on startup, so that is probably 
normal.  Didn't know they had a self-test, that's interesting.

What kind of tires does the car have on it?

I do agree with you, in a way.  The war on drugs has failed, but in my opinion,
that doesn't mean we have to give up.  Only change the tactics.

For instance, here are how some penalties should be changed.

Dealing Coke -- Death
Dealing Heroin -- Death
Dealing Pot -- Death
Dealing Crack -- Death

The list goes on and on!!!......

JUST KIDDING!!!

However, on a more serious note, I do believe that we should take some money 
away from the foriegn operations in South America and costly border 
interdiction efforts.  (Don't think I'm going to say, ""spend it to educate 
people"", because I know plenty of educated dopers).  Actually, spend it on  
things like drug treatment programs.

I saw an interesting story on 60 minutes about how the British actually 
prescribe and addict his ""recommended"" dosage, and try to ween him off from it,
or cut the amount down to levels where it is ""acceptable"".  Sounds good so far 
from what I heard with a decrease in cost, lower addiction rates by wiping out 
the dealer's markets, etc. (But that was the only thing I have heard about it.)

However, legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to be 
bought like cigarettes is just plain silly.  Plus, I have never heard of a 
recommended dosage for drugs like crack, ecstasy, chrystal meth and LSD.
The 60 Minute Report said it worked with ""cocaine"" cigarettes, pot and heroin.",18

I have made this clear elsewhere but will do so again. Khomeini put a 
price on the head of someone in another country, this makes him a jerk
as well as an international outlaw. Khomeini advocates the view that
there was a series of twelve Islamic leaders (the Twelve Imams) who
are free of error or sin. This makes him a heretic. In the Qur'an 
Muhammad is chastised for error directly by God; the Qur'an says that
Muhammad is the greatest example of proper Islamic behavior; thus
no muslim is free from error. 



Perhaps it seems so to you, but this is hardly the case. There is
widespread agreement about matters of Islam. There certainly are
many viewpoints on issues which are not particularly Islamic in
and of themselves, but this is so for any large group of people
under the same name. 


The Qur'an is not particularly imprecise in wording, though it is true
that several interpretations are possible in the interpretations of
many words. However, as an entire text the Qur'an makes its meanings
precise enough for intelligent people free from power lust to come
to agreement about them.

One of the rules for a permanent swap file is that it must be contiguous
(non-fragmented) space.  I suspect that is more responsible for the
difference than the amount of free disk, in your case.


It depends on what you are running.  We had to increase our swap

believe the Beetle corners better.

"FYI:  The actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an HP
deskjet is 1/600th inch.  The electronics and dynamics of the ink
cartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch.
On almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.

The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer
results in much less spread than ink drop technology.

It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and
electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than
inexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printers
offer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1
ppm for an ink jet printer.

Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the
life of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about
$US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield)
cartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over the
life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are
less than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closer
between the two technologies.  Laser printers are usually desinged
for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product
replacement cycles.

"The Toshiba has a 200ms access time, the NEC has a 280ms access

somewhat important, but not as vital in the case of CDs as data

rates of 300K/second. Any is a good choice. Apple's is very cheap
when included with new Macs and I agree with Christian's comment

    ""Unlike the PLO's almost exclusive focus on civilian targets, the
100 troups from the Irgun and Stern group that struck at Deir Yassin
on April 10, 1948, targeted the village for its military importance.
Deir Yassin was on the road to Jerusalem, which the Arabs had
blockaded, and it housed Iraqi troups and Palestinian irregulars.
Snipers based in Deir Yassin were a constant threat to Jewish citizens
in Jerusalem.

    ""Arab civilians were killed at Deir Yassin, but that attack does
not conform to the propaganda picture that the Arabs have tried to
paint. The number of Arabs killed was generally reported to be about
250. In 1983, however, Eric Silver of _The Guardian_ (Britain)
interviewed a survivor, Mophammed Sammour, who testified that 116 out
of a population of 800-1000 were killed. 'About three days after the
massacre,' Sammour explained, 'representatives of each of the five
clans in Deir Yassin met at the Moslem offices in Jerusalem and made a
list of the people who had not been found (alive). We went through the
names.  Nothing has happend since 1948 to make me think this figure

Maybe we should start a newsgroup for the distribution of encrypted 
posts intended of members of affinity groups with a shared private
key.  For example at the coming up Cypherpunks meeting, a private
key corresponding to that particular meeting could be passed out
by a moderator.  Minutes, followup comments to other participants,
and so on could be posted to the alt.encrypted group for the use
of the people who attended. Communiques intended by the group for
non-attendees could of course just be signed using the private key
but otherwises not encrypted.

Starting a alt.encrypted newsgroup rather than just maintaining
mailing lists is better for several reasons.  First, it would be
easier to archive for people who might join a group ""late"" and
who might like to easily read earlier posts; second, traffic analysis
to know exactly to whom an affinity message is directed would be foiled;
three, a newsgroup is much more public and would serve to publicize
available privacy measures on the internet.

And it would be fun to accumulate a secret keyring full of such
keys -- it beats giving out t-shirts as a door prize.

We could send a copy of alt.encrypted directly to Judge William

"Hello, 

   Let me introduce a problem:

   When I measure a sinusoidal wave (voltage) with a digital voltmeter, using 
AC mode, my output is an rms value (a peak value over 2 squared). / Right? / 
   When I measure a square wave in the same mode (AC), my output is equal 
to a peak value, actually, to the upper flat boundary of the wave.
   I assumed, that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the 
input value, and divides it over the wave period. / Right?/
   Now, I used it to measure the same  square wave as above, but distorted 
by high-frequency harmonics. Ideally, output should be the same, but...
The output value was only about 10% of the previous one! 
   Why? What is the nature of this output value? What does the voltmeter 
actually measure? And what does it show?  

   Related question (less important to me):
   What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with 
analog ones?

                              TRANSLATION

 The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material
nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free
from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be
established in the self.
  
                                PURPORT

 All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three
modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which
cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive
activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of
sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna,
as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to
the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the
beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme
transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are
struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of
the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get
rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense
gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the
chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the
Upanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a
part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the
beginning of transcendental life.

 As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in
the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities
such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating
such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This
transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one
is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.

Kratz comments above show otherwise.


Bingo - now the question is, does the Glock's qualify?  Let's see
the evidence that Kratz uses.


But first an aside.  Having an air gun proves nothing.  Moreover,
my comments are based on what Kratz writes.  He's free to argue that
he babbles in text but actually knows something off-line.


Harder than what?  I note that almost all revolvers work the same way,
so it can't be ""harder than revolvers"".


Sure they can.  (Moreover, we know now that Kratz' sample is
unrepresentative.)  We can look at the reasoning.  It is basically
""these Glocks are dangerous because they're not like my 1911/S&W third
generation.""  Part of that is true, but since those same people don't
claim that revolvers, which share the relevant property, are
dangerous, we see that the argument fails.


Why would I care?  I'm not looking for more bogus reasoning.

What do you mean by ""police band"" - there is no such thing.

Anyway, radar detectors work in shared bands.
If you applied your test, all of those radar operated door
openers in malls would be illegal.

One of the great problems here is that there are too many
ill-educated (read illiterate) people making too many laws
about subjects on which they are incompetent - there may well
be laws refereing to ""police bands"", they are almost certainly
local in scope (state or county) - created by well-meaning,

One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have

     But good ones can collapse somewhat, then come back the next year.
Burleigh Grimes went from 20+ wins and an ERA of 3 or so in '24 to 13-19 and
an ERA around 4 in '25.  He pitched well for several more years.  Carlton
won 13 and lost 20 the year after his 27-10 record. (Source: Bill James
Historical Baseball Abstract.)
     And let's not forget John Tudor, who started 1-5 and finished 21-6 in
1985.  He had a pretty bad ERA when you take Busch Stadium into account at
the start of the season.


     If I recall, he had a 4.50 ERA in the 1st half and a 3.50 ERA in the
2nd half of last year.  
     Hmmm, 21 runs in 11 innings.  Suppose he starts 30 more games, and winds
up w/200 innings pitched.  If he allows 4 runs a game in the next 189
innings, he'll have a 4.75 ERA or so at the end of the year. (I think I have
his totals right.) This is going to be hard to come back from.


     My 1st hunch is that Morris is very gutsy, and that he may be pitching
through an injury and not telling anyone.  My 2nd guess is that he will be
banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts.
(Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL?  Or will Danny Cox, who went 3 or 4
scoreless innings against the Tribe today, start for Morris?  He looks like
a really good one.  Gaston is scrambling to find starters, I'd imagine.
Luckily, the Jays have a very good offense.)
     I don't think they would dare release him before the end of the year.
He'll just be replaced by Stewart or Cox.",9

One should be aware that foreign doctors admitted for training
are ineligible to apply for resident alien status.  In order
to get the green card they have to return to their country and
apply at the embassy there.  Of course, many somehow get around
this problem.  Often it is by agreeing to practice in a town
with a need and then the congressman from that district tacks
a rider onto a bill saying ""Dr. X will be allowed to have permanent

"After reading some of the reports of possible NHL moves to Milwaukee or that
Milwaukee should have an NHL team, I thought I'd pass along a story I heard
recently.  This is second hand, so I don't know how true it is, but I have

Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge
hockey team.  The owner of the Admirals (sorry, I can't remember his name)
either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the
Bradley Center.

Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise, but 
turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was too
high.

Like I said, I don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor, but if
it's true, don't look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon.  The Admirals
aren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an NHL club

Hello.  Firstly, what do you exactly mean by ""fundamentalist""?  I will
for the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes
that the bible is God's word to mankind?  I suspect that what happened
to him is what he'll call being ""born again""?  Anyway, was that recent?
If the answer is ""yes"" to all the questions above, it is quite
understandable.  However, IMO, I'ld rather give advice to your friend!
I think I've been through something similar to him, and one thing I can
say is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to
communicate from different worldviews.  Why he talks about those things
is because they are now ""obvious"" to him.  What is ""obvious"" to him is
not obvious to you.  Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because
from his point of view, he has been on ""both sides of the fence"".  This
I mean that before he turned ""fundamentalist"", you two are agreeable
because both of you see things from the same side.  If suddenly, as if
a new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the
discovery of let's say a new continent, or a new planet.  To him, he's
got to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than
where he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now.
You have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to
you, eventhough he may end up offending you.  To him, it is worth that
risk.  Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand
and listen to you as well.  At this moment, it may be difficult because
he is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about,
however, he may not realise that he's really putting you off.

[...]


So far, I've only been trying to explain things from his side.  However,
I do understand how you feel too, because I wasn't a Christian for a good
part of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or
""fundamentalists"" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their
faith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately,
""religious belief"" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism
is also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief is
inevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise),
it will be a touchy matter.  Like all friendships, it will take both
sides to do their part to make it work.  In this matter, maybe you can
do your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he's
trying to convince you about, that it's beyond you or not your concern
""for now"".  Don't tell him it's nonsense, because to him it is reality -
and that would be a real insult.  He'll also have to be careful not to
insult where you stand too.

Like I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too.
I'll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a
Christian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a little
differently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excited
and just blabbered away about what I've found!  To me, it was too good
not to know.  To some, I was crazy, and I didn't really care most of
the time what they thought.  You will probably think he's crazy too -
but God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that in
mind.  And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real
to him, he doesn't see why God can't be real to you too.

I don't know how helpful this is to you.  But all the best anyhow -
this is quite a challenge for you to face.  By the way, personal
conviction: nobody is ""beyond saving"" except the one we call the 
devil and his hosts.",15
"Hi
	I have an Orchid Fahrenheit VLB with 2MB of DRAM.  It is an S3
86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my
second meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix
from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the
ordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from
them, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say ""Buy the memory
from us"" or something like that.)

	The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a
1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or
enlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB
of memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.
Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I
asked them why, and all I got was ""Your point is well taken, but
Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects.""

	So, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805
drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to
get another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next
generation of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my
system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're
broken.

	If you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805
cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are ""less
busy"".  If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805
product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),
although evenn that might be a misprint.

coulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.",3

   are good, and know the common tricks.

***** Windows 3.1 enhanced mode:

     The Windows 3.1 install program should automatically configure DOS
and Windows for use with the Adaptec 1542.  However, just in case
something went wrong, I'm going to describe some of the changes needed
to get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also, you may have noticed
that installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower, even when
you're not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in
the section called, ""Windows 3.1 runs slowly"".


* MSDOS configuration:

     The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions,
you'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive
(this is the default setup).  You'll also notice that your system runs
much, much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section
called, ""Windows 3.1 runs slowly"", for some ways of speeding your system
up.


* Windows configuration:

     To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the
""[388Enh]"" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry:

	VirtualHDIRQ=Off

I believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry
to SYSTEM.INI, but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you, you
might want to try adding some more lines:

	VirtualHDIRQ=Off
	SystemROMBreakPoint=false
	EMMExclude=A000-CFFF

(You probably don't need the above lines, though.)  The
""SystemROMBreakPoint"" entry is used to enable support for memory
managers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs).


* Windows 3.1 runs slowly:

     Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that
your system is running much slower than before.  If it's not, it's
probably because:

     1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your
	CONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a
	winning solution.

     2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to
	be seen ....

If your system is running much slower than before, this is almost
definitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the
Windows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808
(""SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS""), you must use
Smartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it really
slows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a
factor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for other
solutions.

     Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you
do, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even
destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1.
What you can do is one of the following:

     1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my
	opinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused
	either by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in
	Smartdrive.

     2. Use a driver that provides ""VDS"" services (""VDS"" stands for
	""Virtual DMA Services"").  This is a standard, which is supported
	by Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like
	the 1542) to work with Windows.

     After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the following
solutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that I
am now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* caused
by these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the following
does not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is
strongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster:

1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI
   functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two
   physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your
   CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:

	DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386

   (Windows needs the ""/V386"" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into
   LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies
   about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be
   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it's
   still there).

2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version
   3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers
   in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:

	DRIVER=c:\ASPI4DOS.SYS
	DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386

   Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high
   (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would
   crash my system, but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support
   about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine
   as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.

   On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would
   occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting
   Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my
   C:\WINDOWS\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes
   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE
   the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason
   SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.

   I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of
   ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.

   Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without
   SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider
   these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.

3. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is
   to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer
   needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS
   upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not
   available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only
   three ways to get a copy:

      * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver
	kit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other
	drivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is
	around $75.

      * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, you
	can supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for
	around $30.

      * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0
	for MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in
	different directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is
	included; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two
	hard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy
	of ASPI4DOS 3.1.

Note, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors with
Windows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causing
this, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above
solutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during disk
accesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the
parity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off
timing for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run various
memory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no
problems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal
timing requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers
(this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems
show up only under disk I/O).  However, I'm mentioning this just in case
it isn't a hardware problem.


***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:

     There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a
floppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado Memory
Systems Jumbo 250:

1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive
   constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.

2. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.
   (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.
   However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so
   I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my
   1542.)


* Tape backups/restores take a long time:

     If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may
have to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 ""bus on/off timing"" for best
results when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backup
or restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with
only an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on the
Adaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop,
start and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the
tape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective
tape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean).
This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer
than necessary.

     The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to
transfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMA
to transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs
to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is
not fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops,
rewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).
The default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is
""too large"".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to be
transferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the
tape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec ""hogs"" the memory too
much (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to
memory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the
tape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops,
because data is not fed to it quickly enough.

     The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  The
default factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off.
The ""bus on"" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can
be done in one of two ways:

* If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the ""/n"" option.  For example, I use
  a ""bus on"" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the
  following line in my CONFIG.SYS file:

	DEVICE=c:\aspi4dos.sys /n4

  Note that there is NO space between the ""/n"" and the ""4"".

* If you don't have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a
  program called ""SETSCSI.EXE"", which is very difficult to find.  The
  reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to
  want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for
  Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have
  anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to
  hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have
  it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so:

	setscsi -n:4

  This adjusts the ""bus on"" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running
  SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the
  factory defaults.

  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use
  ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I
  could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however.

Do not lower the ""bus on"" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it
above 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard disk
throughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4
microseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you may
have to adjust it downwards a little.

     Once you've lowered the ""bus on"" timing, tape backups and restores
should run faster.

     Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other
options that I have intentionally not described), unless you know what
you are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by
starving memory refresh.

     A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless
this has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while),
this is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple
of other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the
bus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I tried
running this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, I
was running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn't check to see if there was a
conflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B,
although the docs say that it works with the 1542A?


* Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:

     This ""problem"" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my
system, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it.
However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so I'm
mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my
1542.

     Symptoms of this ""problem"", which persists even after cleaning the
tape head:

1. Backing up to tape encounters ""unusable sector detected"" errors,
   resulting in an aborted tape backup.

2. Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.

3. The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.
   Unlike the above-mentioned problem (""Tape backups/restores take a
   long time""), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,
   this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.

4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other
   programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software
   (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the
   tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot.

5. Too many tape read errors.

     Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered
that using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, I
upgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy
controller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, I
initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, I
decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on
the motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250)
reliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly
able to find and use the tape drive.

     I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542.
On the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached
to the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the
1542.  On the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached to
the 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different
controller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my
1542.  I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that
the problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is;
however, if you're having similar problems, you might want to consider
trying a new floppy controller.


***** Sound cards:

     Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and
this is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, the
Adaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the
tape DMA, this ""conflict"" usually manifests itself as a parity error
(your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is
that, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the
Adaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a
parity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is a
hardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity
error is not a symptom of bad hardware.

     I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording
digitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase
the recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo,
recording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).

     Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the
Adaptec's ""bus on"" timing.  See the section on tape drives for
information on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or may
not solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity
error.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect
this problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, the
speed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also
affect this.


***** Miscellaneous info:

     This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Much
of it is merely information that I've heard or read about, and have not
verified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I'm
not sure.  Use it at your own risk.

* With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the ""DB=""
  parameter (e.g., ""DB=2""), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver.
  If you don't, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM
  manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that
  a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM
  command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install
  program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of
  QEMM probably need this parameter, but I'm not sure (I've never used a
  version earlier than 6.00).

  If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the ""DB="" parameter.

* Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one
  gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you
  need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is
  still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec.

* To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and
  some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces
  (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three
  choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following
  solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand
  information):

     1. You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package, which lists for
	something like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers,
	you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact
	Adaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains
	everything that you need.

     2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by the
	same people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM
	drivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not know
	the list price, but I've seen this package sold for around
	$80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS
	driver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS,
	you may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead.

     3. [This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been
	obsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit, but I'm mentioning it in
	case someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the
	drivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410
	kit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of
	MSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included in
	the ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin
	boards.

* To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows
  how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are
  (again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how
  well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the
  following is secondhand information):

     1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large
	number of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers
	(ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.

     2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup
	program (see the above section on CDROM drives for more
	details).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, but
	requires, ASPI4DOS.

* I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:

     1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS.
     2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers.
     3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, and
	CorelSCSI! drivers/programs.

  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:

     4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI
	drivers).

* Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar
  for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you
  need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used
  this version of GNU tar, but I've heard that it works (I don't know
  how well, though).  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet,
  a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites:

	PD1:<MSDOS.DSKUTL>
	ASPIBIN.ZIP  67841 920131 Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives, Adaptec 154xx
	ASPIPAT.ZIP  21206 920131 Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 1.10
	ASPISRC.ZIP 221370 920131 Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape, Adaptec ctrlr

  I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve; UNIXFORUM might
  have it, if any forum does.

* As far as MSDOS is concerned, the 1542A and the 1542B controllers are
  the same; with MSDOS, the 1542A should work as well as the 1542B.
  However, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and
  there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work
  with a 1542A, but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of
  BSD Unix).

* In case anyone's curious, here's an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file:

	FILES=40
	BUFFERS=40
	BREAK=ON
	STACKS=10,256
	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4
	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF
	DOS=HIGH,UMB
	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys
	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p

  Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.  If I were using ASPI4DOS
  3.0 or 3.0a, I'd probably have to use a CONFIG.SYS that looked like:

	FILES=40
	BUFFERS=40
	BREAK=ON
	STACKS=10,256
	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4
	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF
	DOS=HIGH,UMB
	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386
	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys
	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p

  If I weren't using ASPI4DOS, I'd probably use something that looked
  like:

	FILES=40
	BUFFERS=40
	BREAK=ON
	STACKS=10,256
	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386
	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DB=32 DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF
	DOS=HIGH,UMB
	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys
	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p

  However, if I used a floppy-controller-based tape drive, or if I
  planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card, I would still
  need some way of changing the Adaptec's bus on/off times.  The first
  two versions of CONFIG.SYS take care of this, but this last version
  doesn't.

Hmm, here are a couple:

1) If the algorithm becomes known, it will be easy to produce
pin-compatible non-crippled chips that provide -real- encryption and
privacy, because their keys are only in their users' hands.

2) Since SkipJack is a symmetric key cypher, it needs some way to
agree on a session key. The released information says that any
protocol may be used (e.g., DH). From a theoretical point of view,
this is probably true. However, from a practical point of view, those
chips must have some kind of key exchange protocol built-in. What if
it is good old RSA? This will mean that the producer will have to pay
lots of bucks to PKP. By keeping the details secret this can be

Subject: Re:  Clipper Chip

I just had another conversation with NSA to clarify some of the features
of Clipper.  Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages
on Clipper.

The name of the encryption algorithm is ""Skipjack.""

Martin Hellman had written

                and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part
                message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK
                producing

                     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}

To which I responded:

        My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the
        ""family key"") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by
        law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?

I was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK.  However, Skipjack
being a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt key
for the family key SK.

        The unit key, also called the ""chip key,"" is generated from the
        serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks
        derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.
        Compute the 64-bit block

                R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]

        (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with
        two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.
        (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that
        they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are
        concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and
        the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.

The seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed on
a laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people
so that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used during
an entire ""programming session"" to generate keys for a stream of serial
numbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be
thrown out if desired).

The serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formed
by padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding
for each value).

The resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired
up with their serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  The
floppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two
escrow agencies.

Please remark, that in posting this, I do not automatically agree
with it's contents and implications. So don't swamp my mailbox :-)

I just think this is an valuable addition to the less than technical
discussion that is rising here. And, no, I don't mind if you call
S1 and S2 'backdoor', as I could imagine the key-generation process
working without these seeds and the dependency of K1,K2 from the

"The situation: running a Fortran executable that creats an Xterm.  An option
in the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats
a Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics.  Typing a <RET> while
the Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be ""Tek-term"") is
active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus
to the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the 
Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of
Xterm.  If what I'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.)  

The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it.

Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics 
highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move 
the Tek-term to the top.  If the Tek-term has been iconized to conserve 
screen space, it stays an icon.


The desired behavior: one of two options - 

    1. Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the 
       inactive one.

    2. Whenever the Tek-term is inactivated, it should revert to a icon
       but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher 
       level than the Xterm.

What I think I need: a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tek-term will
be at the highest level and a way to iconify/expand a Xterm and Tek-term.
These commands, would, I'd guess, need to be in the Fortran or in the 
command that starts up the Xterm and Tek-term.

Other information: All this is taking place on a VT-1300 (a DEC dumb 
X-windows terminal) connected to a VAX running VMS and Motif.

Perhaps instead of this silly argument about what backup lights
are for, couldn't we agree that they serve the dual purpose of
letting people behind your car know that you have it in reverse
and that they can also light up the area behind your car while
you're backing up so you can see?

Backup lamps on current models are much brighter than they used
to be on older cars. Those on my Taurus Wagon are quite bright
enough to illuminate a good area behind the car, and they're 
MUCH brighter than those on my earlier cars from the 60s and 70s. 

Insofar as Vettes having side backup lights, look at a '92 or '93
model (or perhaps a year or two earlier too) and you'll see
red side marker lamps and white side marker lamps both near the
car's hindquarters.  Those aren't just white reflectors. ",7

	This window is anchored at the spot where you want to write,

No.  There are two problems here:

(1) Peter died two millenia ago.  The original letters he wrote have
long since decayed into dust.  If he were alive today and I could
question him, then this might lend credibility to your claims (but
probably not much, because after all, I've heard people claim with all
sincerity that they've spoken with Elvis recently).  But after his
death, Peter's writings were transcribed by monks for centuries, and I
find it hard to believe that one of them somewhere didn't decide to
change the wording of something to make it (in his opinion) a little
easier to understand.

(2) Even if Peter did witness the miracles of Jesus two millenia ago,
that doesn't mean that your deity is what the Bible says it is (God
might just be Satan, trying to convince everyone that he's a nice
guy), or even that your deity is still alive and active in the world
today.

"This is turning into a FAQ


Here is how to violate your Quadra 700 warranty and install your own
memory.

1)  Insert usual disclaimer here
 
2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and
    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static
    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do
    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back
	of the mac.
 
3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the
    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.
    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the
    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may
    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power
    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you
    need release.
 
4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon
    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable
    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.
    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed
    to release it.
                                            
5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount

6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A
    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop
    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful
    here.

7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the
    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding
	posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then
	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.

8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM
    slots.

9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to
    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their
	chips facing the front of the motherboard.
	
    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in
	sets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely
	and firmly into a fully upright position.
	
10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the
    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about
	1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into
	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.
    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks
    into place.
	
11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY
    DRIVE CABLE.

12) Replace the phillips head screw

13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.

14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount",4

Whether there is a ""why"" or not we have to find it. This is Pascal's(?) wager.

Suppose the universe is 5 billion years old, and suppose it lasts another

on earth if nothing else we aren't so scared.

"In light of my recent paranoia concerning government proposals, I'd love to
see a UNIX-based encryption scheme that:

1) Kept some files encrypted on the host machine (say, all the files in your
   home directory)
2) Used a key system that could not be compromised by eavesdropping over a
   modem line.

It seems that this would require modifications to a shell program and a
way of telling whether a file was encrypted or not, among other things.

I'd love to know about potential security holes in such a system.

Does such a system exist?  If it were made easy-to-use and readily
available, I think it would be a Good Thing(tm).  I realize that this
would probably just involve putting a nice front-end on a readily available

You totally forgot the original post that you posted Allen. In that post
you stated that the ""wrap"" was on top of and in addition to any overhead.
Geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true.


Come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing
what and who is working on integration. This is simply an ad hominum
attack and you know it.


Of course there is a fee. It is for administration. Geez Allen any
organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate
costs, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support
a program and ""wrap"" as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap
was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you
say is not true. Which is it Allen?


As you have posted on this subject Allen, you state that wrap is over and
above overhead and is a seperate charge. You admit here that this is wrong.
Nasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen. Get some
numbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then
howl to high heaven about it. Until you do that you are barking in the wind.


Integration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was 
done here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of
Reston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are
completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There
is no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project
that it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for 
Apollo?


Oh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big.
They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it
replaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your
bias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just
how wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what
they want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it. 


I agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful
large scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that
integration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called
leadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for
the success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership
and responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up
as Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC
and they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to
finally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the
process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.

There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that
for a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the
turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is
lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of
leadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a
symptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your
efforts that you do not see this.


No, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have 
happened in the first place.

I have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is
at reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened, totally
ignoring the lack of leadership of congress. This many headed hydra that
has grown up at NASA is the true problem of the Agency and to try to 
change the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative of
your position.",14

But a disk compare utility (old versus new) will.  And Windows 3.1 is
also flexible enough at install time that you can copy all the files
onto your hard disk, which greatly speeds things up and makes them
less annoying, if you can spare the 7 or so compressed megs.


No, we're not.  But we're also not going to promote pandering to
corporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience.  I don't *like*
dealing with floppies.  Personally, I have no use for changing the
registration info, but I see it as a valid need, and one that ought to
be solved using a quick little utility rather than a half-hour
reinstall that's just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one
way or another.

So, while I'm not going to put much time into it myself, here's the
procedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information:

1.  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want
to install it.  I've been using c:\WINSTALL myself.

2.  From there, copy that directory to something like c:\WINORIG.

3.  Install from c:\winstall.

4.  comp the two directories to determine changes.  
    i.e., comp *.* \winorig\*.* >\report.txt

5.  Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assuming
they didn't cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least one
file should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locate
said offset in the original directory and see what's there using a hex
editor, and do the same for the modified one.

6.  You're on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don't
really do cryptography.  It's probably just an xor key or something; I
think MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing
his copy than with ""real pirates"" who will probably just disassemble
the damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just about
any obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original
floppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be able
to back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing a
compare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that).

As I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and
don't do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one
directory to another may be less arduous.  Doing some of the stuff
I've mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft, as if
they'd ever find out.  If you aren't careful with the disk editor, you
could also mung something important... duh.  I guess that's a
disclaimer.

Have at it....

Ouch. :-)   This brings to mind one of the recommendations in the
Hurt Study.   Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity
to highly prized and easily damaged anatomy, Hurt et al recommended
that manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the, er, step function
provided when the rider's body slides off of the seat and onto the
gas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the 
rider doesn't.  I think it's really inspiring how the manufacturers
have taken this advice to heart in their design of bikes like the

God has one set of rules for all his people.  Paul was never against the

"Dear Rob,


Sometimes I do come across condesending, and I am sorry I come across that
way at times.  Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll
try to get better.

Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle
approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far,
only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both
cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse
for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.

Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. 
vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is
an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  
I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with
his set of excuses.  

I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants
to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses
which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the
Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being
sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.

From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man
standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I 
see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away
from the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see
the dialog:


Me:  ""Brian K, please step aside before you get run over."" 

BK:  ""There is no truck.""

Me:  ""Turn around at look.""

BK:  ""No.""

Me:  ""Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at
     the oncoming truck.""

BK:  ""No. Explain to me why trucks exist.""

Me:  ""Turn around or you will run over.""

BK:  ""No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.""

Me:  ""You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing
      to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.""
      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.

BK:  ""It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.
      Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.""
      And by the way, I really have an open mind.""


So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?   

I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not
billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people
fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.
I can now see the truck behind Brian.

My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the
truck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out
of the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself
to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if
he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that
to change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment,
Brian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he
does not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his
head will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is
satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. ",19

SPACE SHUTTLE ANSWERS, LAUNCH SCHEDULES, TV COVERAGE

    SHUTTLE LAUNCHINGS AND LANDINGS; SCHEDULES AND HOW TO SEE THEM

    Shuttle operations are discussed in the Usenet group sci.space.shuttle,
    and Ken Hollis (gandalf@pro-electric.cts.com) posts a compressed version
    of the shuttle manifest (launch dates and other information)
    periodically there. The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE
    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly
    included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or
    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming
    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.

    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news
    frequently.


    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?

    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks
    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).

    The ""Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,"" ASC G&C 2102,

	""During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is
	commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower
	clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)
	orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a
	negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other
	advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort
	maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of
	the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining
	downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target
	in second stage.""

    This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try
    to interpret.

    1)	We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.

    2)	Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack
	between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the
	""relative wind"") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line
	between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly
	negative angle (""a negative q-alpha"").	This causes a little bit of
	""downward"" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z
	direction) and this force ""alleviates structural loading.""
	We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the
	most ""delicate"" part of the vehicle.

    3)	The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more
	mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or
	to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be
	the case if we didn't roll (""performance gain"").

    4)	The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated
	flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort
	maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (""decreased abort maneuver
	complexity"").

    5)	The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio
	antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio
	antennae on the Orbiter (""improved S-band look angles"").

    6)	The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a
	helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.

    7)	The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is
	more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east
	(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity
	in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:
	velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.
	The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its
	velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.

    This all begs the question, ""Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give
    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to
    achieve that attitude?""  The answer is that the pads were leftovers
    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one
    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main
    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime
    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is
    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the ""top""
    [Orbiter side] and the ""bottom"" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The
    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented
    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the
    Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle
    guy.)

    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.	He added that the ""roll
    maneuver"" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.
    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons
    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping
    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw
    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total
    maneuver is really expressed as a ""quaternion,"" a grad-level-math
    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element
    array.


    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT

    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite
    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72
    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed
    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from
    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.
    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite
    for these viewers.

    If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.
    It's worth asking if yours doesn't.

    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is
    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press
    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle
    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying
    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions
    are not being covered.

    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the
    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.

    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160. No mission audio but they
    transmit voice bulletins at 0245 and 0545 UTC.

    Frequencies in the 10-20m bands require USB and frequencies in the 40
    and 80m bands LSB. Use FM for the VHF frequencies.

Boston will beat Quebec in 6.


Pitt in 6. The Bruins arent a pushover.
The hawks havent had problems with them  all year. Yep, I agree.

Unless the Hawks can somehow change fate, you're right.  

Who knows, though.  Maybe some intensive forechecking aka normal Hawks
style will nullify a seemingly unbeatable team.  Maybe the Pens are due

" 	WASHINGTON (UPI) -- Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Tuesday
 there are better ideas to stop the human slaughter in the Balkans than
 ordering American fighters to bomb the Serbs, but a frustrated senator
 told him to do just that.
 	``We've not done a damn thing,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., told
 Christopher at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
 ``Preventive diplomacy is not in your capability right now in Bosnia-

 what he characterized as a limp response to the Serbian policy of 
 ``ethnic cleansing'' of Muslims, including rape and shelling of
 civilians.
 	``The time has come for us and the world to stop bemoaning the fact
 that all the options are bad ones,'' Biden said. ``They are all bad ones
 and we ought to pick a couple.''
 	Biden also endorsed lifting an international arms embargo against the
 former Yugoslavia so the Muslim-dominated Bosnian government might have
 a chance to at least defend itself against the Serbs.

"I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've 
transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means
infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is 
granted to copy this without restriction.

Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an
informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.
ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and
International Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the
company is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that
his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.

The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga
to visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,
who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which 
the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,
His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought
there probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous
satellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,
seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of
slots.

The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl
Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions
supporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from 
70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).
According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the
world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and 
the Pacific Rim. 

RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax
haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to
fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have
cost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money.
Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began 
negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in 
Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time.
Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way
that people operate.  For example ""everybody can sell you everything.""  
Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the
only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.

Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost
of $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg
says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who 
went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was
out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He
again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,
he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the 
Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions
before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to 
allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.

The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied 
Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in 
Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built
about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that
siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest
people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this
point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on
both siberians and midwesterners :-)

Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is 
apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that
would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them 
specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites
that RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This
compares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1
million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their 
satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They 
have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give
you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are
getting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place
now.

Tidbits:

*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big
business because big business is just like what they have over there, except
that ""we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.""

*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch
within 9 months.

*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement
fund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,
and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is
sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.

*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried
partly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying
monolith.  Italy gets a new government ""every two weeks"" but we don't worry 
because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what
really goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.

*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering
money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting
25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the ""equivalent"" value in 
rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian
bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that
the only the contractors get swindled by the government.

*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western 
satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type
of satellites, which was rather reassuring.

*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive
technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have
a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare
well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much 
shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the 
difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,
shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer
technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date
hardware.

Actually, it does make a reasonable amount of sense. Fixed disk
sectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to
memory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is
quite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the
controller/cpu know how to use the bus). Since the 286 wasn't cached,
the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance, and
it's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more
loss of CPU cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence.

The floppy, on the other hand, is not buffered, so that using the CPU
for floppy data transfer (as was done on the PC Jr, by the way) really
does stink.",3

"Someone sent me this FAQ by E-mail and I post my response here.

[I'm not enforcing the inclusion limits on this FAQ because most
of our readers probably haven't seen it.  --clh]

Christ warns that anyone who ""breaks one of the least of these
commandments *and* teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in
the kingdom of heaven"" (Matt. 5:19.  This FAQ is so full of error that I
must respond to it.  I hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the
partisan theology.


1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom
4:15 notes that ""where no law is, there is no transgression.""  Not only
did sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it
was revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).

2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise
which undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the
people, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised
""what ever He says to do we will do.""  That is why the new covenant is
based on ""better promises"" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law
God promised to ""put my laws in their minds and write them on their
hearts"" (Heb. 8:10).

3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The
Sabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt
had been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been
even more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly
Sabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at
any time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was
*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).

4.  Israel stands for God's people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*
the Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the
covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises
belong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born
into Israel is not enough ""For they are not all Israel, which are of
Israel"" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says ""if ye be Christ's, then are ye
Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.""  All Christians are
Abraham's seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the
criterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the
promise God made to all his people the Israelites.


People would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath
commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the
ceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even
if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan
sun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,
sanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders
agree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in
soc.religion.christian.bible-study).
I do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God
says.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,
why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the
Sabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important
enough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that
the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but
freed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in
court I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me
grace, do I walk out of the court saying ""I can now go on speeding, for I
am now under grace?""  Being under grace I now drive within the speed
limit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 ""Di we then make void the law through
faith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.""  ""Wherefore the law is
holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good"" (Rom. 7:12).


Do you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows
that the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did
not go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to
Assos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate ""lay by him in store""
with ""go to a worship service.""

Wrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath
day of the moral law.
Why would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments
which conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a
God who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could
not be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a
broken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law
breaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to
follow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to
make false gods, to violate God's name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to
kill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight
when placed next to the word of God.

Darius

[It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I
think Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is
probably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing
what he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally
accept that those who ""esteem all days alike"" are similarly doing
their best to honor the Lord.

However I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous
proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I
indicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.

The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually
about something else.  They both look like they are talking about
nnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says ""and they
gathered every Sunday for worship"".  We get various pieces of
information, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  

Act 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple
worship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the
temple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of
Christians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn't tell us
what day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius'
confusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no
reason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the
Biblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to
me that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn't say they gathered to
see Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,
Paul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that's just not explicit
enough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says
that on the first day they should set aside money for Paul's
collection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially
to do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can't disprove it,
but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be
when they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do
it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.
So I think the most obvious reading of this is that ""on the first day
of every week"" simply means every time they gather for worship.  

I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements
is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian
worship was.",15

...In these and similar areas, the
Bureau has violated not only the dictates of common sense, but of 5
U.S.C. Sec 552, which was intended to prevent ""secret lawmaking"" by
administrative bodies.
   These practices, amply documented in hearings before this Sub-
committee, leave little doubt that the Bureau has disregarded
rights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the United
States.
   It has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise
of the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens.
   It has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search-
ing and seizing private property.
   It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property
without just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with-
out regard for their right to due process of law.
   The rebuttal presented to the Subcommittee by the Bureau was
utterly unconvincing. Richard Davis, speaking on behalf of the
Treasury Department, asserted vaguely that the Bureau's priorities
were aimed at prosecuting willful violators, particularly felons ille-
gally in possession, and at confiscating only guns actually likely to
be used in crime. He also asserted that the Bureau has recently
made great strides toward achieving these priorities. No documen-
tation was offered for either of these assertions. In hearings before
BATF's Appropriations Subcommittee, however, expert evidence
was submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF
gun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither
criminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into
unknowning technical violations.

Letter to Constituent: April 1993
 
 
Thank you for contacting me regarding the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms (ATF), which is the Federal law enforcement agency with
jurisdiction over firearms violations and regulations.
 
It has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations
Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government which
funds ATF, that ATF is one of the most competent and highly
professional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government.
The agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in
successful, legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use
of firearms, especially in the area of  drug-related crimes.  It
enforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory
minimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out  an
illegal activity.  The Bureau has made itself a key component in
preventing gang related violence, also, both by educating at-risk
youth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known
gangs from access to weapons.
 
The Waco, Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF
on the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession
(automatics, semi-automatics, and machine-guns, in addition to bombs
and other explosives.)  In virtually every gun case, ATF is asked to
trace weapons through its' National Firearms Tracing Center, where
they keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information.  ATF
is the Federal governments' firearms expert and routinely works with
state and local police to execute warrants.  ATF, working with state
and local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S. Attorneys' office
felt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally
establish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and
thorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members
of the Branch Davidians.  In addition, ATF carefully selected a
Sunday morning, knowing from their source, inside, that the men would
be separated from the women and children and not in the area where
it was known that the illegal weapons were stored.
 
As you may be aware by now, Vernon Howell a.k.a. David Koresh
spiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending
execution of the search warrants.  Unfortunately, ATF lost the
element of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  and
prepare for ATFs' entry into the compound.  Once a hostage situation
presented itself, the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the
FBI is skilled in hostage negotiations.  In addition, and military
tanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and
firepower of the Branch Davidians.
 
Based on what I have learned about ATF's role in the Branch Davidian
raid, I believe the agency acted responsibly.  I am, however, deeply
saddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who
attempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the
cult.  I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct a
thorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside
the Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for
Enforcement.  In addition, ATF will conduct its' own review of the
Waco operation.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of the
evaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick
and peaceful conclusion.

Not hard, you can do the refreshing and access cycles by software, but

I've seen some application note from Philips that used one of their

that was accessed and refreshed with software bit-banging.

Another alternative would be to use one of those nice DRAM controller

Earlier, I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs.  One
guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well,
I saw one think that someone said about ""Show me a team that used Split-
fires....""  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories
about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.

Splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and
increased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires
increased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing
on horsepower numbers.

Now how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that
depends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?
In the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,
but 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.
So for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.

But what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,
but many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for
the hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,
twins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this
translate?  Increased torque should ""theoretically"" help twins make
more power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods
or anything made, just stick 'em in.

Now I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with
somebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than
4's.        

As far as racing teams....  Ducati team ""Fast by Ferraci"" used
splitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James
running for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then.
Also, somebody check to see if they had them in 88.....

C'mon, you still haven't corrected yourself, 'wieneramus'. In April 
1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus. A 
number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German
officials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian
Paikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku.
Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his
Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the
creation of an Armenian SS formation in order 

""to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the 
 spirit of the Nazi ideas.""

He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories
of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish
homeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels
Propaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language
radio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were
produced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2]

    Jahre Deutsch-Armenische beziehungen,' (Heinz Holzberg
    Verlag-Oldenburg 1988), pp. 124 and 129.


The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored
by General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the
establishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any 
official position. His views were represented by his men in the
respective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro
and Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942.
Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after
a long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to
Berlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] 

A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not
'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy.
As such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians
were the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August 
1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of
Racial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.

#2	ROB ZETTLER		Season:	4th
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		C/C-

Zettler gave the Sharks every bit he's got this year; unfortunately, this still
wasn't enough to make him any more than a marginal NHLer, if that.  He works
hard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to
costly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an
offensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed
to make the team next year.

#3	DAVID WILLIAMS		Season: 2nd
Acquired:	'91-92, free agent from New Jersey
Grade:		C/C-

IMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92,
playing a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and
good defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City,
was good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that
'91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he
was prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the
playmaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last
year.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.

#4	JAYSON MORE		Season: 2nd
Acquired:	'91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft
Grade:		B+

After being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp
before '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was not
particularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then,
proceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's most
reliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play
steady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.
Offensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73
games), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the
defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.

#5	NEIL WILKINSON		Season: 4th
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		B-

Wilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However,
partially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25
games total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed
even when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners;
that is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if
he can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.

#6	SANDIS OZOLINSH		Season: 1st
Acquired:	'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft
Grade:		I (A)

At the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers),
Ozolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injury
in that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games),
but he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points),
which, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from
their defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, he
was playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still
susceptible to so-called ""rookie mistakes,"" but was probably the defenseman who
made the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back
from his injuries, he is ready to be a star.

#19	DOUG ZMOLEK		Season: 1st
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		B

Zmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks
to play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but
after being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points).
He was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the
team; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough
physical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to
become a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and
defensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.",10

"I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my
wife and me lately: liturgy, in particular, Catholic liturgy.  In the last few
years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It's
driving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is
that what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to 
do it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we 
present to God.  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers.

Lately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion
of sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do
(which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next) is growing.
Example.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usually
on Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, taking
the role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say
""Crucify him"" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we'd do it
again.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were ""invited"" to sit
during the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian ""invitation"", 
I was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seems
typical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the
musicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the
liturgy and since no one knows what's happening, the new things have to be
explained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we're just
sitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is about
to be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay
""experts"", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has a
bias toward doing something rather than nothing--that's just a fact of
bureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for
people to be aware of the Lord's presence.

So we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass
going down?  I don't mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or
Friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware 
of God's presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should 
just offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational
participation in Catholic Masses lately?",15

My daughter has Epilepsy and I attend a monthly parent support group.
Just Wednesday night, a mother was telling how she decided to throw
all the junk food out and see if it made a difference in her 13 year-old's
seizures.  He was having about one seizure per week.  She reported that
she did this on Thursday (3/11), he had a seizure on Saturday and then
went 4 weeks without a seizure!!  On Easter he went to Grandma's and ate 
candy, pop - anything he wanted.  He had a seizure the next day.  She 
sees sensitivity to nutrasweet, sugar, colors, caffine and corn.  With
corn she says, he gets very nervous and aggresive.  

With my own daughter (age 7) , I think she is also sensitive and stays

Such as?  Not being able to get married isn't a roadblock to a permanent

to break up.  This is an excuse used by homosexuals because the

 As you have presented it, it is indeed an argument from incredulity.
However, from what I have seen, it is not often presented in this manner.
It is usually presented more in the form, ""And *besides*, I cannot see...
...nor have I ever been offered a convincing explanation.""
 Moreover, it is not unreasonable to ask for an explanation for such
phenomena. That theism does not provide a convincing explanation is not
an argument in theism's favor. Especially when different theisms offer 
different explanations, and even different adherents of what is purportedly
the same theism give different explanations...


 Not im my experience. In my experience, the most common reason is the
lack of evidence in theism's favor. You mileage may vary. :->


 Oh, heck, I'll be snide this once. :-> It's also fairly easy to attack
arguments that are not made. (I.e. 'strawmen'.)

Yes.


Well, for example, the goal of ""natural"" morality is the survival and
propogation of the species.  Another example of a moral system is
presented within the Declaration of Independence, which states that we
should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  You see,
to have a moral system, we must define the purpose of the system.  That is,
we shall be moral unto what end?


Well, murder violates the golen rule, which is certainly a pillar of most
every moral system.  However, I am not assuming that our current system
and the manner of its implementation are objectively moral.  I think that
it is a very good approximation, but we can't be perfect.


Well, ""objective"" would assume a system based on clear and fundamental
concepts, while ""arbitary"" implies no clear line of reasoning.",0

I've got the 6.0 spec (obviously since I quoted it in my last posting). 
My gripe about TIFF is that it's far too complicated and nearly

In a nutshell, I don't think TIFF is salvageable unless the fat is
trimmed significantly- and then it wouldn't be TIFF anymore.  They
keep trying to cut it back, but it's late now.  Maybe they >will< fix it,

"terminated

It is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any
macintosh if you can find the space to put it. I have a IIsi that came
with a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in
another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.
 
First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum
quarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them
was stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a
problem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for
over two months.

The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal
hard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just
splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard
connector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare
cable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found
in any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly
soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of
shorts or bad connections.

Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk
ribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what
I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another
male connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,
and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a
crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not
damaged, and I can go back to the original setup.

Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for
power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this
day. 

In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of
the drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are
intact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it
seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal
should be terminated at all the ends.

Let me know if you have any more questions.",4
"I am a novice (at best) in working with pc networks, and am in the
process of planning a small accounting system for a small business.

The particular need in this case is for three machines, each in a
different office of the same building, each having access to a
Windows-based accounting system.

My first thought is to set up MS Windows for Workgroups on each of the
machines (likely a 486 and two 386's) along with the appropriate Ethernet
cards and cabling that come with the Windows for Workgroups starter kit (one
additional user kit will be necessary).  It then seems logical to purchase
a simple multi-user accounting system, along the lines of DacEasy or
M.Y.O.B., and fire it all up!  The 486 will more or less act as server with
a report/check printer attached to it.
Cable runs of 30-40 feet will be necessary for this setup.

Well, this all seems too easy to me.  Would any of you network gurus out
there tell me if I am out of my mind here?  Any and all suggestions, however
trivial, will be immensely appreciated.  My apologies if this has been
brought up before.

Thanks!

COM3 or COM4 in the port tables. Programs like most modem programs which 
write directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call 
fails. Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER. Put 
""device=pf.sys"" in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat. 
This little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the BIOS 
tables are updated. It works great. PF will also let you swap ports and 
such also if that is of any value to you.",3

Hate to wreck your elaborate theory, but Steve Dyer is not an MD.

Yes, everyone who is normal does that.  We use candida on the other arm
when we put a tuberculin test on.  If people don't react to candida,
we assume the TB test was not conclusive since such people may not
react to anything.  All normal people have antibodies to candida.
If not, you would quickly turn into a fungus ball.


You've just discovered one of the requirements for a good quack theory.
Find something that no one can *disprove* and then write a book saying
it is the cause of whatever.  Since no one can disprove it, you can
rake in the bucks for quite some time.  


That is odd, isn't it?  Why do you suppose it is that MDs with these
common problems don't go for these crazy ideas?  Does the ""professional
jealosy"" extend to suffering in silence, even though they know they
could be cured if they just followed this quack book?

The idea is commercialized in at least one product, the Private
Eye.  That's a small cube-shaped device that the user straps around
the head similar to a sweat band.  There is a boom that comes from
the side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned
in front of the user's eye.

The Private Eye we had here for evaluation was Hercules-MDA
compatible.  The innards are a row (~400 LEDs) that are swept up
and down by a galvonometer-like movement.  The result is that the
sweeping LED bar forms a fused raster.  There is a virtual image
projected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fuse
with the background.

I didn't like the device very much.  I found it easiest to use if I
looked at a blank white wall.  I had problems with focus tracking
if I glanced down to look at my keyboard for an out-of-the-way key.
The unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which I found
annoying.  Some people didn't seem to mind the buzz.  Properly
used, however, the image clarity was quite crisp.

""All"" is a *very* big number.  The AT&T Long Distance network has

That doesn't even count the amount of traffic in the LOCAL phone companies,

On the other hand, I can easily see them recording the traffic for

"I've used on-chip capacitors to reduce ground-bounce noise on a small
systolic array chip that had 50pF loads on the clock lines.
(Design was in 2-micron n-well cmos, using the MOSIS scalable design rules.)
Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors:

1) They don't help much with simultaneous output switching--there is
	still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the
	load capacitor (on both the signal line and the ground
	return), so you still get ground and power line bounce. 

2) They do help a lot with on-chip loads, as I had with the high load
	on the clock lines. 

3) The transients you are trying to suppress are really high
	frequency, so forget about large areas of poly-thin-oxide-diff
	capacitors, since the RC time constant is too large.
	What I did is to make a metal2, metal, poly, diff sandwich,
	but put a lot of holes in the poly layer, allowing frequent
	diff-metal1 contacts.  I forget exactly how wide the poly
	lines were.  If I were doing this design again, I'd probably
	omit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead,
	using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high
	resistance it can be ignored at these speeds).

4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with
	slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for
	output signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors.
	I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for
	a MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as I
	needed.

I wish I could agree with you.  Ask yourself this.  Why would any private
sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least
partially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance)  Why would any
private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly
evaluated?  (i.e. algorythm not publically released)
The answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn't.  There is other hardware out
there not compromised.  DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.)

My suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper
systems.  If not we're in trouble.

Given that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd like
to think so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this.
They know their initiative will fail, much as crippled DES was never taken
seriously.  The only way their moves can work is by coercion.  You know
little about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step
in the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move, banning
or SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the ""Clipper"" system is easily
justified ""Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying
to subvert the government?  We've provided you with a very secure alternative
so use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever.""
How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing
law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system
the only crypto available in the U.S... ?  You simply can't, and the administration
knows it.  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it for
drug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems.

Don't sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can't be THAT stupid.
Either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations
collective I.Q. is about that of a potato.

Why do you think AT&T jumped on so fast?  They know it's going to be big,
and NOT because it's better.  Right on the face of it, noone will buy the
stuff that doesn't have to.  AT&T must know this too, THINK MAN, why the
hell would they jump the gun?


I really wonder.

To wit:  The letter I just sent to Clinton:

The White House
Office of the Press Secretary c/o:
Presidential Comment Line (fax)
(202) 456-2461
 
April 17, 1993
 
Sir and/or Madam:
 
 
I must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and
cryptography.  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.
 
It is apparent to me that those who drafted the ""Clipper Chip Proposal"" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the ""Big Brother Proposal"") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep





ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from ""experts"" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.
 
In addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how ""tamper proof"" the key escrows might be.
 
I cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the ""Clipper Chip Proposal"" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti





lize the ""Big Brother Chip.""
 
Unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like ""harmony,"" ""right to encryption,"" and ""voluntary.""
 
It mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is ""I can't believe it's happening here.""  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; ""When is the Reichstag fire planned for?""

Why should we expect the cops to be honest!  They're underpaid
for the risks they face every day.  The media dumps on the all

Besides there are lots of cases of police abuses ranging from
protection scams to outright robbery (when I worked in D.C. there
was a breakin at a local Radio Shack and the alarm company heard the
cops responding to the call over the audio pickup in the store:-).

:What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you,
:at the end of the wiretap, they should be obligated to inform you that
:a tap was performed, and replace (for free) the clipper chip in your
:cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the
:escrow houses.

Then you would know that Big Brother had been listening.  Does he
really want to let you know?

:Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are
:laid?   In many ways, it would be a positive step if they had to.
:Judges set time limits on warrants, I assume.  At the end of the time
:limit they should have to renew or replace your chip.

:That's if we go with this scheme, which I am not sure I agree with.

I'm completely against anything that makes it easier for the
government to encroach on the rights of individuals.  The
founders of this country spent a lot of effort limiting the power
of the government and specifying exactly what the governments
rights were (and this didn't include a gov't spy in every
bedroom).  IMHO, there are entirely too many things going on
today designed to preserve the government organism at the expense
of individuals.  Look around and reread 1984 and many early
Heinlein books.  Aren't there many parallels between the thought
police (can you spell Waco Texas?), and Heinlein's ``Crazy Years''?

some of the harddisk tools to check if there is any physical damage to
my harddisk and report always turn out to be none.  The surface test
only slow down for a certain section of the disk and turn back to the

it is a harddisk problem or some other problems. Anyway help or comment

Portuguese launch complex??? Gosh.... Polish are for American in the 
same way as Portuguese are for Brazilians (I am from Brazil). There is 
a joke about the Portuguese Space Agency that wanted to send a 
Portuguese  astronaut to the surface of the Sun (if there is such a thing).
How did they solve all problems of sending a man to the surface of the 
Sun??? Simple... their astronauts travelled during the night...

"Frequently of late, I have been reacting to something added to
restaurant foods.  What happens is that the inside of my throat starts
to feel ""puffy"", like I have a cold, and also at times the inside of my
mouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy.

The situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants
(usually chinese), the most notable cases:  a cheap chinese fast food
chain, a japanese steak house (I had the steak), and another chinese
fast food chain where I SAW the cook put about a tablespoon or two of
what looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice.

I am under the impression that MSG ""enhances"" flavor by causing the
taste buds to swell.  If this is correct, I do not find it unreasonable
to assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell.

Also, as the many of the occurances (including two of the above)
involved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG, this is
what I suspect as being the cause.

I wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animals
showed it as being harmless, as it would be very startling to hear a lab
rat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny.

Anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are
totally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studied
they know of.  I will probably respond to them however with a reminder
of how long it took to prove that smoking causes cancer (which the
tobacco companies still deny).

- DM

(If I sound grumpy, it's because I had beef with broccoli for lunch
today, and now it hurts to swallow)

It works on xterms. At least I have no problem with it. - Back to the original
question:

I usually start new xterms by selecting the proper menu entry in my desktop
menu. Here is a sample command:

	xterm -sl 999 -n ls12i -title ls12i -e rlogin ls12i &

The -n and -title options give the text for window and icon. As I use the
tcsh (a wonderful extension of the csh), I can do the following:

I have an

	alias precmd echo -n '^[]2\;${HOST}:$cwd^G'

in my ~/.tcshrc. This is a special alias for tvtwm. It is executed each time
before printing the prompt. So, I have the current host name and the current
directory path in the title bar of my xterms.

"Well, it looks like the folks in soc.religion.islam have loosened up
a bit and are discussing this topic as well as the banking/interest
topic.  A few books on the subject have also been mentioned in addition
to the one you mentioned.  These may be hard to find, but I think I may
take a stab at it out of curiosity.  I know the one film I saw on this
subject was pretty weak and the only two quotes I have seen which were
used to show science in the Koran (which I posted here) were also pretty 
vague.  I suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on the
quotes they have.

At least one poster on the Islam channel seems to have some misgivings
about the practice of using the Koran to decide what is good science.

I wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the Christians
""Creation Science"" on any topic.  It would be interesting to find a history
of scientific interpretations of the Koran, to see if anyone used the Koran
to support earlier science which has since been discarded.  It is all too
easy to look at science as it exists today and then ""interpret"" passages
to match those findings.  People do similar things with the sayings of
Nostradamus all the time.",0

While I don't read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radar
information (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting..

I bought a '93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles)
after debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude, 
and Celica.

Check this month's Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.  

My criteria: a ""fun"" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K.
I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out.
The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag.
Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS).
The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy.
The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.  
I didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me.
The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went.
The Celica was ""ok"" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat
overpriced too) in non-turbo form.
I never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it
for its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind.
I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more.
Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)

The car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its
reliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:

My dislikes:
Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.
Headlights have ""stuck"" up a few times (weather?)
air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)
condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely.
crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)
parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts
underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).
assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not 
stitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke.
Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!
Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when
I bash my head on the corner.
horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)
Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car 

My Likes:
engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1
handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)
transmission (the 5 speed is a must)
usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)
Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive)
stability at 100+mph (high gearing though)
low cowl (good visibility in front)
Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)
ABS/Air bag (see above)
rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)
No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)
Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)

As you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't
have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling
point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  

The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed
much since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work
each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the
Probe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a 
potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.
If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find
that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides
differently (if that's ""better"" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass
around you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty
hot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about
the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with
the heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.
Leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so
I can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  
I prefer cloth to leather anyway.  

I wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the
inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume
that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water 
generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper
controls are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the
Eagles (and I was really trying).  
There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT
has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic
that could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm
rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth ""pouch""
but that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO.
And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!

Lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the 
water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.

Implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against Winnipeg with Selanne
on the ice can be blamed on him...Roger, he is a FORWARD.  Winnipeg has a
lousy defensive record anyway.  Let's put it another way.  John Cullen's +/-
is terrible.  What's your excuse for him?  That his powerplay points don't
count?  Neither do Selanne's... 


Knowledgeable hockey observers the world over would agree that
feeding Selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to
winning.

"The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14,
1993 issue of USA Today (""Drug Use Up At Younger Age"" by Mike
Snider, p. 1A).

    Drug use is on the rise among kids as young as eighth graders -
    usually 13 - and they're using more LSD and inhalants like glue
    and air fresheners, says a new survey.

    The annual National High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse finds
    ""statistically significant increases"" in eighth-graders' use of
    many drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, crack, LSD and inhalants.

    ""We may be in danger of losing some ... hard-won ground (in reducing
    drug use) as a new, more naive generation of youngsters enters
    adolescence,"" says Lloyd Johnston, University of Michigan, chief
    researcher on the study sponsored by the Department of Health and
    Human Services.

    But drug use among high school seniors is continuing a decade-long
    decline.

    The study of 50,000 students shows the percentage who tried the
    following in the 30 days before they were polled:

        * 8th-graders  - alcohol 26%; cigarettes 16%; marijuana 4%;
                         cocaine 0.7%.

        * 10th-graders - alcohol 40%; cigarettes 22%; marijuana 8%;
                         cocaine 0.7%.

        * 12th-graders - alcohol 51%; cigarettes 28%; marijuana 12%;
                         cocaine 1.3%.

    Among 12th-graders, use of marijuana, cocaine and inhalants
    declined over the year before.  Not so with LSD.

    * 2% of eighth-graders have tried LSD in the last year, up 24%
    over 1991. 

    * Use of LSD among seniors is at its highest point since 1982; 6%
    tried it in the last year.

    Reducing drug use among students ""requires a different kind of
    strategy"" that Health Secretary Donna Shalala says will be part
    of an overall illness prevention plan.

    The survey shows drugs are easier to get and fewer eighth-graders
    disapprove of them.

    ""It's scary,"" Shalala says.  ""Dealers are focusing on younger, more
    vulnerable kids.""

I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net.
My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in schism

What does the Roman Catholic church say?  Excommunication can be
real apart from formal excommunication, as provided for in canon law.

After all we Orthodox don't cinsider ourselves schismatic or
excommunicated.  But the Catholic Church considers us dissident.

    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses
in the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.

1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force
air into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake
valve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only
the difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after
the exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the
intake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing
atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time
does the pressure ever become ""negative"", or even approach a good
vacuum.

2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the
combustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up
to the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume
of gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume
that must flow through the intake, because of the temperature
difference and the products of combustion.

3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started
paying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty
horsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,
substitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost
zero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very
well anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make
very little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is
_much_ louder than the stocker.

4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.
If free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference
was noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.

5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any
given RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it
on the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.
Pumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.

"----------------------------------------------------------------------
Open letter by Dr. Paul H. Blackman, Research Coordinator for
NRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear sir:

By now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication
of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are
drawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of 
momentus ""scientific"" findings. These are regularly released to the press
without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and
often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings.
Generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however
meaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle
serious studies by criminologists.

The latest effort -- ""Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide:
A Tale of Two Cities,"" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying 
editorial, ""Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,"" by two employees
of the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult
to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few
data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length
to call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular
order.

	1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to 
	support the statement that ""some have argued that restricting
	access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate
	of homicide."" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that
	contention.
	
	2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very
	similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,
	demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities
	are very different with very different demographic characteristics
	which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in
	Seattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white
	and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be
	the same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-
	grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various
	ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.
	
	3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,
	compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all
	the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect
	in 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-
	1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth
	involving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM
	article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving
	handguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that
	one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding
	that a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that
	a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day
	for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without
	at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?
	
	4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national
	gun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily
	selected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because
	it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific
	reason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which
	involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar ""control""?
	Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite
	""scientific"" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide
	rate *exceeds* that of such ""wild west"" cities in Texas as
	El Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado
	Springs. (Ref. 3)
	
	5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or
	handguns ""are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in
	Vancouver."" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending
	to study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is
	an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry
	permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in
	Vancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of
	handguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun
	owners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number
	of handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns
	for the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns
	legally for protection, registration figures are
	meaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York
	City (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,
	that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population
	in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver
	has a greater ""prevalence of weapons"" than New York City.
	
	The second method of measuring gun density is ""Cook's gun
	prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity
	differences."" But the validation was by Cook of his own
	theory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a
	different doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is
	based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement
	in suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking
	a measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide
	(42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in
	homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in
	Vancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-
	ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and
	Vancouver.
	
	6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and
	Canada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that
	Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to
	the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian
	law for owning and carrying handguns for personal
	protection. The authors also make it appear that it is more
	difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually
	the case.
	
	7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain
	the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the
	penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of 
	clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a
	firearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number
	of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making
	arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest
	rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences
	imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,
	or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social
	scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,
	the authors of the NEJM ""tale of two cities"" fail even to mention
	most factors related to crime control.
	
	8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective
	means for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not
	the case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost
	650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from
	criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the
	liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be
	completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury
	to the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors
	reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides
	without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle
	accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides
	involving firearms.
	
	9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the ""study,""
	editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it ""applied
	scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb
	advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly

                             GUNS AND SPUTTER
                            by James D. Wright
          (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)

   suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.""  The problem is demonstrated
   by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting
   to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by
   the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal
   of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and
   suggested that a handgun ban ""may reduce the rate of homicide in a 
   community.""
      The nine medical doctors who published ""Handgun Regulations, Crime,
   Assaults, and Homicide"" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite
   many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver
   has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations
   make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems
   indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period
   1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.
   Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,
   Why?
      The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case
   to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,
   that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their
   evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and 
   unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point
   does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support
   of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody
   knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We
   are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that
   a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates
   when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.
      Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two
   indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-
   weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons
   permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the
   permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable.
*     The second bit of evidence is ""Cook's gun prevalence index,"" which stands
*  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index
*  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in 
*  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage
*  of homicides and suicides involving firearms.
*     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides,
*  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take
*  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be
*  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides
*  is directly related to their relative availability in the general 
*  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To
*  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to ""prove"" it on the basis of
*  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.
      Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that
   guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.
   The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun
   ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates
   reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,
   that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.
      In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of
   violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the 
   consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin 
   Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime
   for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke
   an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.
      Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data
   on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are ""similar in
   many ways,"" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law
   stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish
   the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that ""all
   else is equal"" among things being compared.
*     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look 
*  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime
*  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage
*  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle
*  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent.
*  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the
*  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half-
*  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown
*  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out.
*     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is
*  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates
*  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide
*  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver.
*  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due
*  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks,
*  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics
*  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison
*  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial
*  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle
*  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain
*  in either city.
      Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the
   cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority 
   groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in ""gun availability""
   (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not
   matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why
   blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed
   in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,
   do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)
      Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between
   Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have 
   anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol 
   abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city
   of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the 
   Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the
   United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian
   percentage?
      The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many
   ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent
   more detailed analysis, nearly any of these ""many ways"" might explain part
   or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such
   as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal.
*     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide
*  result in a ""complex picture.""  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing
*  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They
*  also acknowledge that ""socio-economic status is probably an important
*  confounding factor in our comparison,"" remarking further that ""blacks   
*  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of
*  Vancouver's population.""  Given the evidence presented in the article,
*  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle
*  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial
*  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility,
*  since ""detailed information about household incomes according to race
*  is not available for Vancouver.""
      The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in 
   gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple
   example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms
   of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one 
   would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.
   Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce 
   crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into
   account?  In this example, the ""hidden variable"" is city size: Guns are
   more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city
   problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the
   appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very
   seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities
   for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,
   and their results are impossible to interpret.
      In the editorial ""Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science"" accompanying
   the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the
   authors for applying ""scientific methods"" to a problem of grave public
   heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from
   nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate
   plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them
   out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are
   little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this
   study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical
   identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--
   is cause for further concern.

Title 18, 241 and/or 242 seem to apply.  241 is conspiracy (two or
more persons) against rights of citizens.  242 is deprivation of
rights under color of law.  Both call for up to life in prison if
death occurs.  Reno, Bentsen, and Clinton are probably all principals
to the crime (as they are responsible for authorized actions on the

I didn't mean to offend or anything, I'm just quoting Stanky himself on
the subject. I remember one time last year he was being interviewed by
ESPN, and the interviewer (can't remember who), asked Stanky if he was
Jewish because he (the interviewer) was Jewish and wanted to see more
Jewish ballplayers. To which Stanky replied, ""I'm Polish, not Jewish.""

So maybe that wasn't the most PC thing for Stanky to say, and maybe I was
a little naive when I posted it. I think we should just devote this
subject to finding actual Jewish ballplayers (I myself am Jewish and the
only ones I ever knew until now were Koufax, Greenberg, and Blomberg).",9

"MSG is common in many food we eat, including Chinese (though some oriental
restaurants might put a tad too much in them).  I've noticed that when I
go out and eat in most of the Chinese food restaurants, I will usually get
a slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards.  This happens to many
of my friends and relatives too.  And, heh, we eat Chinese food all the
time at home :) (but we don't use MSG when we're cooking for ourselves)

So, when we put one and one together, it can be safely assumed that
MSG may cause some allergic reactions in some people.

Stick with natural things.  MSG doesn't do body any good (and possibly
harms, for that matter).  So, why bother with it?  Taste food as it should

If he had a history of such things, why was it not mentioned in the

got his drinking money from?

I can't say exactly who is at fault here, but from where I sit is
looks like we're seeing the results either of the law going way out
of hand or of shoddy journalism.

If the law wants to attach strings to how you spend a settlement, they
should put the money in trust.  They don't, so I would assume it's
perfectly legitimate to drink it away, though I wouldn't spend it that

"---------------------------
The federal government has used such laws to allow mutliple charges in
order to prevent more crimes than would nromally occur just from two people
being pissed off at each other. The federal government has an interest in
the intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations of
civil rights. It's the way they broke the back of the Klan, by putting a
lot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically.
It is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally valid
since over 100 years ago. It has been used whenever a select group was
getting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for being
part of a minority. It is the only way we made the defeat of the south
stick after the Civil War. People who harrassed free blacks, when normally
they wouldn't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around were
expeditiously tried and jailed for 5 to 8 years until nobody wanted to try
it anymore. Now with the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under
the law, the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intent
as much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority to
somebody. They can call out the national guard just for them, as they did
the school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 1950's, and the
president can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of the
militia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at the
thousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obey
or face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms! And by god,
they did! Those southern boys turned right around an fixed bayonets! And
the governor was left standing and was arrested by the federal marshalls
that had brought the order to nationalize the guard. And that's why we need
such an ability in federal jurisdiction.

The danger in philosophizing about science is that theory and generalization 
can end up being far removed from the actual day-to-day of the grunt at the
bench.  Yes, its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into the
lab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it
(as long as my advisor doesn't catch me - which is easy enough to do), but 
stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review 
committees and the peer review process in general.  In today's world that's 
what determines what science is: what gets funded.  And a damn good thing to.
Flights of fantasy just don't have much chance of producing anything, at

that actually has a good chance of producing some results.  MD's seem to

gun permits to carry them at all times ""so as to contribute to

Yehoshua Matza (Likud), Chair of the Knesset Interior Committee,
stated that he intends to demand that the police department make
it clear to the public that anyone who wounds or kills
[non-Jewish] terrorists will not be put on trial.

Ha'aretz, 16 March1993:

Today a private security firm and units from the IDF Southern
Command will begin installation of four magnetic gates in the Gaza
strip, as an additional stage in the upgrading of security
measures in the Strip.

The gates will aid in the searching of [non-Jewish] Gaza residents

"Hmm, followup on my own posting... Well, who cares.

First let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the
Clipper-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us:

The chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs
general encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB
ECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithm
consists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data
seems to be 64 Bit? Yes.
So if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when 
Clipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key. 
(Or is it one key per direction ?)
They can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however.
Somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip
which is now ready to work.
The clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's), and 160 Key-Bits.
These 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number
with 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip)
At beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??)
before sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipper
chip put's out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number,
and the session key. This might look like
X{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2], serial number}
where X is a transformation of these 3? Packets involving a family-key.
This family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???)
After that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet
being encrypted and decrypted by Clipper.

Denning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160
Bit's.

Now, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not
being an American Citicien(tm) [ :-) ] , there are some weak points in this
scheme, which might be exploited by several parties.

As far as I know about the generation of K1,K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the 
obvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing
the serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I really can't
imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sources
for the generation of the K1,K2 can be bought for not to much money.

Then, the escrows. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Security
could (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits
each, which have to be xored together to give the K1,K2. Now let's simply
assume the escrows are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals or
law enforchemnt agencies. (And there will be no quarrel between escrows
and l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so on
and so on) Once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding
chip is compromised forever. Not very clever, IMHO [ :-)) ].
How about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that
the police (or whoever) want's to listen to? Escrows could then simply decode
this session-key and send it back to police. (And would naturally not do this
after the warrant has expired...) This would be a better technical solution,
but I guess politics will not work that way.

Apparently (as Miss Dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes
of intercepted messages shall be the FBI. Great. So local guys can not inter-
cept (understand) your traffic anymore. Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes
the right to do legal wiretaps ? (How is law over there, I have no idea who
is allowed to tap, and who not) This certainly means that watched communi-
cations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company
to the FBI, if the communicaiton is a watched one. And this means as far
as I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching-
company, and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. So the family-key
will not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable
by anybody who cares. I _like_ traffic-analysis!

What do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ECB mode, and the
first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? So the session
key would not be actually broadcasted over the line? Hmmm. Shouldn't be so
difficult to do *that* :^)

And now a last point, for the other side. After all I have read and heard about
Clipper (not the programming language for dBase, is it ? [:-)]) it seems
to have many advantages, which shold not be overseen!


Now an afterthought to your rights. Please note that I have no idea what I am
talking about!!!

"Dear folks,

I am still awaiting for some sensible answer and comment.

It is a fact that the inhabitants of Gaza are not entitled to a normal
civlized life. They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967
without civil and political rights. 

It is a fact that Gazans live in their own country, Palestine. Gaza is
not a foriegn country. Nor is TelAviv, Jaffa, Askalon, BeerSheba foreign
country for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians
are concerned and as far as common sense has it. 

It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens
and the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionists
will begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same
rights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.

Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel
is entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should be
entitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel
to enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master
and slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.

To close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistence
and means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a
crime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss 
to which Israeli society has degraded. 

I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain
why Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return
and live there ? Would they be allowed to, if they converted to Judaism ?
Is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their
religion or ethnic origin ? Please give an honest answer.",17
"I had a similar idea, for a fax/answering machine switch,
to put both machines on one line.  You order distinctive
ringing from your phone company.  This is $3/month here.
You get a second (unpublished) phone number.  When
someone calls this number, your phone rings with short
rings instead of long rings.

You set up your answering machine on 4 rings and your fax
on six rings.  You'd give out the new # as your fax #.
A device would measure the length of rings.  When it
detects a short ring, it turns off your answering machine.
Five rings later your fax picks up the call.

This should be cheaper and more elegant than the $80
switches now available.

But that's not what I did.  I'm giving out the new
# to my friends and customers.  This should leave the
old # for telemarketers, etc.  I won't pick up the
phone when I hear the long rings.",12

GOT HIM!  Cramer is now claiming that pedophilia is a sexual orientation
rather than a chronicly homosexual condition.  This changes the whole
argument in as much that is pedophilia is a sexual orientation all
of its own peds cannot be called homosexual.  Peds are peds who
may have a preference as to the sex of the child they molest (though
most do not have a preference) but that is a subset of their basic
ped nature.

Cramer has as much as admitted that peds and gay men are different
orientations.  All we need now is to get him to admit that
the apparent similarities he keeps on about are just optical illusions.

-BTW, I'm a WALC (white aryan lapsed catholic)

-d'baba Duane M. Hentrich        baba@Tymnet.Com
-
   I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich calling
himself an Aryan.  The word `Aryan' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs first
in the Hindu scripture, the Rigveda.  It seems to have been a tribal term
but may have had connotations of good character.  Such connotations
are quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the
eightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholar
Max Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then the
Nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' is
synonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely.  The people who
originally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghans
and possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the word
by Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is
nontheless inappropriate.  The only Westerners who may have some claim
to call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor-
shipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda.

  If you want to check what I am saying, look at  Mallory's book, ``In
search of the Indo-Europeans"" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica.
The reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature
as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and
for Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible
things done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans have
no clear claim.",18

I wouldn't give baserunning that much value.

The above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well.  If
Olerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs an
extra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold
at third.  Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than
Alomar's.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a
double.)

Another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that
the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.  No
team in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players
than others.  Still, the current runs created formulas work just as well
in the 1950's for all teams.  

Bill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example.  They used Harmon
Killebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with
38 times caught stealing.  Yet they scored slightly more runs than
predicted by Runs Created.

It helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least
a reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very short
description of the process which we use; if you have further questions,
feel free to poke me via e-mail.

================================================================
*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion

0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This
   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are
   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.
   Consider deleting these edges.

1) Now, there are two goals:

    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)
    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)'s)
       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured 
       using the digitized (x,y)'s).

2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For
   example:

    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you
       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will
       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the
       Reference(x,y). 
    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.
       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge
       the correct length (where ""correct"" is the DigitizedLength). 
       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the
       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the
       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.

3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).

alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider
how much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist
on the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to
balance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length
of the edges.

WARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be
observed (essentially, you can't allow the convex hull to change, and
you can't allow triangles to ""fold over"" neighboring triangles.  Both of
these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of
individual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using 
the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the
original positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was
prohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and
change code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I
*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more
compute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having
every point interact with every other point....but first read up on
linear solutions to the n-body problem.

There are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on
springs, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.  The
above method is described, in more or less detail in:

   Anas Omran has claimed that, ""the Israelis used to arrest, and
sometime to kill some of these neutral reporters.""  The assertion
by Anas Omran is, of course, a total fabrication.  If there is an
once of truth iin it, I'm sure Anas Omran can document such a sad
and despicable event.  Otherwise we may assume that it is another
piece of anti-Israel bullshit posted by someone whose family does
not know how to teach their children to tell the truth.  If Omran
would care to retract this 'error' I would be glad to retract the
accusation that he is a liar.  If he can document such a claim, I
would again be glad to apologize for calling him a liar.  Failing
to do either of these would certainly show what a liar he is.

The Signetics BBS contain some pretty good items for the 8051.  I am
currently using the following files which I downloaded from them:

    bootstrp.zip      Hex file Load-and-Go using 8051 uart
                      (allows you to download your program into a RAM

    tutor51.zip       TSR for 8051 feature help screens

"} I would like more info on this if anybody has it. Our Exabyte
} 8500 tapedrive has never been working from the Quadra 950.
} We have been trying it since September 1992, replaced cabling,
} inits, I don't know what all. All the ""industry experts"" we
} phoned (the tapedrive dealer, our Apple dealer, the software
} dealer) all say it's our fault, or they don't know. The last
} thing they said was that we needed a special Quadra SCSI terminator
} (???). Anybody know more? Thanks,


I have been using the PLI (SONY) 3.5"" MO drive and now a Sharp color
scanner using standard SCSI cables and STANDARD $20 terminator on my Q700. 
No problems.  If you were using a IIfx, that might be another story.

Make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the
end.  Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and
others are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations
cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be
disabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2
boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be
disabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the ""experts"".

My experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they
must have some software package for the Mac to 'talk' to them.  My PLI MO
drive and Sharp scanner has one for each.

Good luck.",4

I'm sure zero-intested economical systems survive on a small-scale,
co-ops is not an Islamic invention, and we have co-operatives working
all around the world. However such systems don't stand the corruption
of a large scale operation. Actually, nothing could handle human

"I recently backed out of purchasing an almost-unused Sony TCD-D3 DAT
Walkman, having found someone else who has a unit I personally prefer (and am
paying more for).  However, it's still a heck of a machine for the price -- it
is quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it.  (It's probably the
most popular walkman-style DAT machine out there.)

        Anyway, the guy selling it is Bryan Davis (bdavis@netcom.com), and
here's what he told me:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is what is included:
        - TCD-D3 DATman.
        - (2) RCA to Stereo 1/8"" plug cables.  One for analog input, one for
          analog output.
        - Optical digital I/O cable (one lead for input, one for output).
        - A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase.  The
          unit is still under factory warrantee.

        Again, I've used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainly
understand why it is as popular as it is.  I've been using one for a little
while, and although I had some problems with it recently, I should also point
out that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and
had truly been _used_ during that time.  (This is the same exact DAT machine
that was lugged around the U.S. and Canada to record the Jazz Butcher
Conspiracy for their recent live album.)

I know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels
in S.F who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reported

        'nuff said.

        The reason I'm not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a
unit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don't have any
optical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has
some other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn't.  (I am also paying more
for the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters are
available if you absolutely must have one.

        Of course, it has SCMS.  All consumer decks do.  (So do Sony Minidiscs,
by the way.)

It was shafting on the part of the Arab land owners for doing it 
without notifying their tenant farmers and for not being responsible 
enough to make provisions for them, but rather just leaving
them to their fate.

The point is that the land was sold legally, often at prices
above its actual value.  It was legal, and good business for
the sellers, though it left the Palestinians who worked the land
in a poor situation.  

I don't know if others share this opinion.  It is mine,
and I'm sure there are some who agree and some who don't
The way I see it, the fallahin were caught in circumstances 
beyond their control, in that since they didn't own the land,
they didn't have a say. Of course, now for the sake of the ""greater 
Arab unity"" the Arabs are angry that the land was sold to the Jews
(an act that is illegal in Jordan), but when it happened, it was just 
business.   

The purpose of buying the land was to provide space and jobs for 
Jewish immigrants.  In any case, no matter what the purpose, 
the sales were legal, so I really don't see any grounds for 
contesting them.",17

                                  Prophecy be
                                   Fulfilled

                                     * * *

       In considering the Christian religion, and judging it
according to its claims, it is important to look at its claims at
fulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy.  The scribe Matthew is perhaps
the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in
the career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's main
strategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even
about the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in
the New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the
authenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at
least 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much
happened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we
will take particular claims at face value.

Immanuel:

       We begin, of course, at the beginning.

       (Mt 1.21-22):  ""[Mary] will bear a son, and you,
       Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is
       salvation), for he will save his people from their
       sins.""  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had
       spoken by a prophet:

       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),
       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made
       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not
       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz
       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its
       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the
       lord G'd said to Isaiah, ""go to meet with Ahaz..."" 
       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,
       naturally) saying, ""Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It
       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.""  But,
       Ahaz said, ""I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a
       test.""  Then (Isaiah) said, ""Hear then, O house of
       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that
       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord
       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman
       is with child and will bear a son, and name him
       ""Immanuel,"" which means, ""G'd is with us.""   He will
       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil
       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to
       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings
       you dread will have been deserted...

Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. 
Further, he the Hebrew word ""almah,"" (young woman), as
specifically, ""virgin.""  But, this is not a prophecy about the
Messiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years
later.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In
short, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of
context, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It
should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general
manner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,
virgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,
the fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by
later Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called by
the name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy
for Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second
class prophecy.   Not too convincing.

Egypt:

       After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a
quick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he
wishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an
alleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.

       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of
       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:
       ""Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.""


What the lord really said was this.

       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. 
       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called
       them (my people), the more they went from me; they
       kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning
       incense to idols.

Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, it
was indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to
return.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of
here.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind
up with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecy
is just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.

Rachel Weeps:

        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that
King Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of
all young male children.  Matthew then writes,

       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the
       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:

       ""A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud
       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;
       she refused to be consoled, because they were
       no more.""   

The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the
carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722
BCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,
and Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are ""no
more.""  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies
before the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.
       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who
was the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and
Bethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her ""children,""
it is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is
that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,
""on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).""
       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely
that such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the
event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,
nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. 
Herod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less
evil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a
prime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance
the message of the church's gospel.
       Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the
infant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set
up by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.
It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention
the rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The ""children"" the prophet
speaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'd
comforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be
returned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this
would not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of are
dead for good.  Again, the ""prophecy"" Matthew sets up is not even
that, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too
convincing.

The Nazarene:

       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find
another Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife
take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, 

       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets
       might be fulfilled, ""He shall be called a Nazarene.""

First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of
the prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who ""He"" is. 
There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,
there are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still
worse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at
all.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother that
she will,

       [Judges 13.5]  ""...conceive and bear a son.  No razor
       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his
       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel
       from the hands of the Philistines.""

This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd. 
But, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has
begun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is
simple making them up now.

Bearing our
Diseases:

       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses
and disabilities.

       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the
       prophet Isaiah, ""He took our infirmities and bore our
       diseases.""

As expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,
and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,

       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has
       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.

From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that
the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation
of Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the
Israelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations
that look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish
identity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the
instrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.
      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which
are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and
discipline.  They do not speak of a ""servant"" going around and
healing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the
sicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,
as we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The
verses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but
rather something that had already happened.  While it is believed
that Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear
the illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say
that, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his
spiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallel
misses where he intended it to have its effect.


Silent Messiah:

      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus
ordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arouse
the attention of the local rulers.

       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by
       the prophet Isaiah.   

       ""Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,
       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on
       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He
       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear
       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised
       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings
       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his
       name.""

The Isaiah passage quoted reads,

       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my
       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my
       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the
       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or
       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a
       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will
       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail
       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has
       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands
       await his law.

You see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,
because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could
never think of Jesus failing, never would the ""light"" of mankind
burn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to
an end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace
G'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will
be the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed
from the Judaic ""...the coastlands await his law."" to the
Christologic, ""the Gentiles will hope in his name.""   While the
original proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it
to fit its strange doctrine of ""believing in the name.""  If one
has any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only
to read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved
but blind and imperfect servant, ""a people robbed and
plundered...""   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at
""prophecy"" is examined, it crumbles.

Three Days and
Three Nights:

      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very
mouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and
resurrection.

       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the
       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son
       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and
       three nights.

Before any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know
how the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was
24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset
6pm.  What was referred to as a ""day"" was the period of light from
6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time
scale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until
6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their
sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. 
(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that
Saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,
when days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight
portions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,
Jesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise
unresurrected for three days and three nights.

      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the ""ninth
hour,"" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the
grave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, ""rose,""
before dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was
over).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for
clarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before
6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm
Friday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means
using Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two
nights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this
is a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we
are even able to have his death involve three days and three
nights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to
suspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little
mistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his
god's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more
than unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.

Hearing &
Understanding:

     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in
parables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if
you were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the
message of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the
parables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand
them, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not
accept the ""plain"" message any better.  Matthew says,

       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in
       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, 

       ""You will indeed hear but never understand; and you
       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this
       people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of
       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they
       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and
       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal
       them.""

The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his
call to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is
flourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. 
Isaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd,
calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.

       [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, ""Go, and say to this
       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and
       see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this
       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their
       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear
       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and
       turn and be healed.""  Then Isaiah said, ""How long,
       lord?""  And he said, ""Until the cities lie waste
       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the
       land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far
       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And
       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned
       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still
       stands when the tree is felled."" The holy seed is its
       stump.

Here we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel
to stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms the
promise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you read
the rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan
of G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look
at Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)
     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion
of Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,
he has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn't
understand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses are
not prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in the
present.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face. 

     Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they
have the prophetic approval.

       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a
       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the
       prophet, ""I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I
       will utter that which has been hidden since the
       foundation of the world.""

Matthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a
prophet, but from the Psalms.

       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will
       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have
       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. 
       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to
       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the
       lord...

As was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come
from a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies
of Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet. 
Apparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some
of it up.
     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once
again, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus
has said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not
understand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. 
Further, they speak of things ""known, that our fathers have told
us.""  Jesus deals with things ""hidden since the foundation of the
world.""  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. 
This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No
wonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,
Matthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,
Christians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't the
only things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.


Excuses of
Little Faith:

       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go
around casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what
epilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were
possesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were
unable to ""dispossess"" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more
enlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying
they didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this
demon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or
he does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move
mountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can
move real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the
Charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to
Mexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old
woman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.

       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in
ancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their
sacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in
heaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and
their great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  

     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time
or a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the
old days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the
theologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see
God anymore.

       We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're
       sinful; it's just his ""plan""; we put too many of our
       own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right
       faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...

     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dear
reader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to be
true. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your
heart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do is
make people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They say
our little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, they
say, ""See the love in these people you worship with... see the
lives of people change... that is seeing G'd.""   Thus people get
lulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday
sights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it is
not seeing G'd the way people used to see.  
      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of
human hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the
forgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created
by the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are
what we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody
has little faith.

Jesus Rides on
an Ass:

       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah
king, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into
Jerusalem.  

       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken
       by the prophet, saying,

       Tell the daughter of Zion, ""Behold, your king is
       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a
       ass-colt.""

Of course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little
differently.

       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and
       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-
       colt... he will command peace to the nations.

There isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariah
only involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the
poetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for
both a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get a
comical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two
donkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,
proctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written
earlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to
Jesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and
shows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has
bungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I
have noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,
the situation is often reversed nowadays...

       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were
angered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,
Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,

       [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of
       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'

It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus
was never one to point out such little ""prophetic"" things AND
since, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to
fit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or
Matthew, ""Haven't you read?"" for the source reads,

       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is
       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is
       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you
       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the
       enemy and the avenger.

The passages hardly need comment.  There is no ""perfect praise""
spoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd,
not his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be
just one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic
scripture.

YHVH said to 
my lord...:

      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish
messiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king
David.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,

       ""The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until
       I put your enemies under your feet.""

Taken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic
descent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of
course, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to
make some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine
nature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if one
is a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. 
But, there are problems.
       In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about the
messiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the
messiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures
about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,
bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's
rule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the
passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the
Christians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this
psalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had
also made.  One must remember that there were various factions
among the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the
messiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like
his audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, and
who interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.
What is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,

       YHVH's utterance to my lord:
	""Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your
       footstool.""

       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule
       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer
       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the
       holy mountains.  

       ""You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek
       forever.""

The word ""lord"" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian
bibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the
word is ""adoni,"" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means
""lord,"" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in
the scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely an
address of respect.  
      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word
refers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is
supposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the
psalm translates to either ""a psalm of David,"" or ""a psalm about
David.""  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court
poet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If the
psalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be
talking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended
from David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensive
tales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include any
praises of a messiah.
     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after
David was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of
favour for David's kingdom on hold.  
     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was
promised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies,
successful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved
the priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,
enabled to bless the people.   It all fits.
      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,
though.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though
his use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this
event is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off
a little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,
though, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of
Mark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. 
Matthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of
an infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As we
might expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by
embarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.

Moses & Jesus,
Had it Together
All Along...:

       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a
pseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of John
deserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed
from the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew. 
But, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early
church leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah
king, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made
by G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of
a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this
was accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the
Christians who came along later decided that they would claim the
fulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the
promise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.

       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,
       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.

It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,
Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. 
I have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament
which corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for the
course to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like
his forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has
many of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they
still cling to it.

The Potter's
Field:

      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by
one of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,

       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver
       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief
       priests, taking the silver, said, ""It isn't lawful for
       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood
       money.""  So they... bought a potter's field with it to
       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was
       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,

       ""And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price
       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the
       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's
       field, as the lord directed me.""

This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament
Scripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name
of the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which
Matthew makes use of.

       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,
       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, ""Cast
       them to the treasury,"" --the lordly price at which I
       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of
       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of
       YHVH.

First of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer
of the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely
a priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people
shortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with
one another.  The word, ""treasury,"" had been replaced by the King
James Scholars with ""to the potter,"" precisely because this made
Matthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The
correct translation of the Hebrew is indeed ""treasury,"" which also
makes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas ""potter's
field"" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was
intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given
Matthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of
intentional dishonesty.
      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the
text.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and if
as most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard
the contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to
toss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah
directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high
priests.  The high priests would not put the money in the
treasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the
opposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,
the ""prophecy"" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New
Testament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincing
enough.

Wine, Vinegar,
& Casting Lots:

      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.

       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,
       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not
       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they
       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that
       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,

       ""They parted my garments among them, and upon my
       vesture did they cast lots.""

First of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour
wine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find
that right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him
some to drink --not polluted with gall.

       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, ""I thirst.""  A bowl of
       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the
       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he
       had received the vinegar, he said, ""It is finished;""

But, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the
prophets, but one from the Psalms.

       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;
       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me
       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and
       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add
       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no
       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the
       Book of the Living.

Of course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request
of drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm
quoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It
is not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that
we run into further problem when we see that the ""Jesus"" in the
psalm asks G'd for the damnation of the ""crucifiers,"" whereas the
Jesus of the gospels says,

       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, ""Father, forgive them, the
       don't know what they do!""

Further, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by
having gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not his
meat, as the psalm stipulates.

       With the ""prophecy"" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally
ask, ""What of the casting of lots?""  This brings up the 22nd
Psalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to
say that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no
great thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon
in those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least
erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does
indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of
Jesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,
his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some
suspicions.

The 22nd Psalm:

      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his
condition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of
praise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it
seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We
will examine the primary passages.

       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! 
       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words
       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you
       don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.

Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. 
This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather
than king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not
fit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as
complaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like ""the
lamb led mute before its shearers.""  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do much
groaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by
both day and night on the cross.

       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... 
       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag
       their heads;  ""He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let
       him deliver him... for he delights in him.""

This seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with the
exception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.

       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their
       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.

       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of
       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and
       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my
       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.

       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my
       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the
       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my
       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!

It would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christian
fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,
this prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words ""have pierced"" really
do not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,

       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of
       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my
       hands and feet...

In Hebrew the phrase ""like the lion"" and a very rare verb form
which can mean ""pierced"" differ by one phonetic character.  The
word in the Hebrew text is literally, ""like the lion"" (ka'ari),
which makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal
imagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that
would urge a Christian to change the word to ""ka'aru.""   But, to
add the needed (yet artificial) weight to the ""prophecy"" this is
just what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the
correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to
Jesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the
translators.

       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend
itself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being
saved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the
psalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know
that crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather
the forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional
thought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on
his palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.

      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not
attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord
Jesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all
the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and
interpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much these
scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down
is a question that has serious repercussions for Christian
theology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful
fundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might
have been ""enhanced"" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,
it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural
matters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good
things for St. Matthew.

The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's
crucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years after
the fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,

       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his
       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...
       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...
       ""The will look on him whom they've pierced.""

Of course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of
context.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of
Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with
them.

       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...
       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations
       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will
       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on
       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have
       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him
       like you weep over a firstborn child.

John's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that
Matthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more
than just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious and
blatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel
writers, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their
religion were founded.


Reckoned with
Transgressors:

       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming
the Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of
the gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.

       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,
       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the
       scripture was fulfilled which says,

       ""He was reckoned with the transgressors.""

Here, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,
about the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the
messiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its
surrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The
verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the
past, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The
servant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the
description of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the
messiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between
two thieves would fulfill the ""prophecy"" in Isaiah.  Jesus would
more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was
considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his
career.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to
steal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could
have had made a better analogy with general comparisons.

       Mark goes on to tell us how ""those who were crucified with
[Jesus] also reviled him."" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a
couple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke
decides to change some things.  Luke tells us,

       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged
       with him railed, ""Aren't you the messiah?! Save
       yourself, and us!""

This certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how the
people who crucified Jesus said, ""Save yourself!"" and that the
robbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,

       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,
       ""Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same
       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,
       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. 
       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,
       ""Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom."" 
       And Jesus answered, ""Verily I say to you, today you
       will be with me in paradise.""

Now, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches
the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking
his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather
strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his
punishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,
apparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to have
been a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by
Luke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.  
Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy
enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made
up, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free
words of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another
example of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and
expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,
the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have
seen.

The End of the
World--
       Mt. 24:

       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and
embarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all
three of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most
unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus
mentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and
his disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world
which he has been warning about.

       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's
       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your
       coming, and of the close of the age?

       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for
       many will come in my name, saying, ""I am the christ.""  
       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for
       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,
       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the
       beginning of the birthpangs.
             They will deliver you up... put you to death,
       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.
       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This
       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a
       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.
             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the
       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to
       the mountains.

             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,
       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from
       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man
       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,
       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out
       his angels... and gather his elect...
             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its
       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know
       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these
       things, you will know that He is near, at the very
       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not
       pass away until all these things take place...
             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the
       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,
       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming
       at an hour you do not expect.

From this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in
within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells
them that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that it
will come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet
their pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. 
But, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his
disciples that their generation would still be around at the End,
and that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be
swept away.
      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant
nature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, ""this generation
shall not pass away..."" really means ""this race of people will not
pass away...""  Of course, the word for generation is used many
times to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. 
It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,
he didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is
quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at
least some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. 
The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking
at the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from
Rev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus
meant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.

       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th
chapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000
years, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,
hearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. 
Surely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how
tired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for
just the right moment to spring?


       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,
(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or
three days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three
eternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for
less trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine
radiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best
interests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore
disappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. 
As has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when
people got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,
Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have
seen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout
Church history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple
belief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with
argumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away
from question.  To question and investigate has never been the
easiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the
prophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely
accepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. 
Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity
have been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support
wars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which
Christianity can securely keep hold.",0

Has anybody actually seen the Tek color space stuff working?  I'm not
having any luck with either the xtici editor from export.lcs.mit.edu or with

The O'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because

(which makes no sense to me).

The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors, apparently because the
mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values.  So
you can't actually edit any colors.

Thank you very much. After reading the text some distinct questions
arised to me, which I guess will also be asked by other people. Perhaps
would it be interesting to find an answer to these questions ?



shorter or longer ?




First question: When will the LawEnforcmentField be transmitted, and how
does the remote Clipper Chip handle it? Is it transmitted periodically
in the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? Does the
phone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever,
or tries it to turn them into voice-output ? (Which would not be disturbing)



Second question: Why!?!? Why is such a strange procedure used, and not
a real RNG ? This turns those S1,S2 in a kind of bottleneck for system-
security.



So no (technical) provision will be taken to place a 'timeout' on these
warrants? This would be a unique possibility to realize such a technical
restriction, by letting the escrow-agencies perform the decoding of the
session key. Just take modem-lines instead of secure fax. Is this such
a bad idea ?



Wow! (How does the randomizer work?) Are the SHA (and Key exchange) secret,
or publicly known ? Key-Exchange is DH, I guess ?

It seems that those who are opposed to this chip shall have a tough time,

  Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since
respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  This
doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in
the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.

  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should
address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like
it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,
and isn't.  
  I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has
forgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we
have something to learn from the pagan movement.
  First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of
oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to
live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ 
could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great
deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the 
male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have
had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.
  Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great
ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings
and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long
tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress
and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human
experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.  
Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism
is an attractive option.
  I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.)
should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of
sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated
sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.",15

I think that you will find that in most moral systems, there is

"As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous
question ""WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD?"" I must assume
that my wife's answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was.

She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it
and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she 
believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.  
(Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the
idea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the 
food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG
be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit
forming) ?

This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (my
children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet
food. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other
brand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some
sort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net, are:
Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for pet
food to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  Is MSG put in 
pet food?

To Andi,

I have to disagree with you about the value of Israeli news sources. If you
want to know about events in Palestine it makes more sense to get the news
directly from the source. EVERY news source is inherently biased to some
extent and for various reasons, both intentional and otherwise. However, 
the more sources relied upon the easier it is to see the ""truth"" and to discern 
the bias. 

Go read or listen to some Israeli media. You will learn more news and more
opinion about Israel and Palestine by doing so. Then you can form your own
opinions and hopefully they will be more informed even if your views don't 
change.",17

Texas freeways are varied, sometimes a good surface. Mostly flat. But,

The front covers should be available from Sony.  Check with a local car
stereo shop.  You will probably (definitely) have to provide the units 
serial number and hopefully you had registered the warranty card.  I 
don't know the cost, but replacements have to be available to people
who damage the face cover, so it stands to reason that it can be replaced.

As to deterring theft:

When I worked for a stereo shop, we referred the customer to a Sony 800
number.  We would not sell the face, nor did we have them available.  Most
people who came in asking for the face cover (or a pullout sleave for that
matter) would look very disheartened to find that they acquired a deck
they couldn't use.  If theft occurs with these decks, notify Sony.  Serial

The system boots up if the Seagate MFM controller is removed from the

The system hangs if all three (Tandberg, Future Domain TMC-1660 &

[insert huge deletion of all following material since it had little
relevance to what I've found]

OK.  The people before Jesus didn't have Jesus, right (so far, I've
announced that space is a vacuum)?  The people who lived during the time
Jesus lived (especially disciples) were taught this:  ""I tell you the
truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing.  He
will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the
Father.  And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may
bring glory to the Father.  You may ask me for anything in my name, and
I will do it."" (John 14:12-14)
So, Jesus asked them to pray for things in his name.  Since that time,
the request has been the same, not to ask for intercession from other
beings, but from Jesus.  Remember that ""there is one God and one
mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as
a ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time."" (1
Timothy 2:5-6.  Also, ""there have been many of those priests [talking
about priests among the Hebrews], since death prevented them from
continuing in office; but because Jesus lives forever, he has a
permanent priesthood.  Therefore he is able to save completely those who
come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.""
(Hebrews 7:23-25).  Hebrews is also full of areas talking about Jesus
being our mediator rather than any other man.

"Well, there *is* a difference.

I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general
_decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical'
curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a
room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature 
5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.

Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have
a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly
cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold
place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,
to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.

Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.
As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis
specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating
temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).

In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember
that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and
radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or
something.

Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized
oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature,
thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature, 
but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.  

If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine
(esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives,
stick to the 10W40.

Yes it is, as has been evidenced by the previous two stages
of withdrawal from the area and by the reductions in troops.
Currently the troops are kept at a level consistent with light

In general, settlers were moved into the territories because

	I guess they beat me to it..  Anyway, I think it would be a great idea to
	develop such a product, perhaps in the underground, as it would otherwise
	probably become illegal pretty quickly here...

It's really very feasible and shouldn't be too expensive - all that's needed
is a box with a phone jack on one side, a DSP in the middle to do codec
functions of speech->compressed bytestream, and an RS232 on the other side.

You'd plug your phone into it, plug the RS232 into your computer, and have
a good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS232 port.  The CPU in the
middle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work on
a byte stream.

With v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream, it should work. 
Quality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone.

At the very highest price, you could use one of those voice-mail compatible
modems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $500 on
the cost of such a box.  In practice, you really ought to be able to get
the price well below $100 - I could do it now in software on my cheap&nasty
home RISC box (Acorn Archimedes) with the digitising microphone I bought
for 25 pounds, if I knew how to write good speech compression software
(which I don't).

The reason it won't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one -
the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip.
Economics, I'm afraid.

However... we can get about 2Kcps throughput on the internet even with
the bottleneck of a v32bis modem.  When we get ISDN for all (ha ha ha)
and the new NREN, it might then be trivial to run compressed speech
over a tcp/ip connection on the Internet.  Perhaps we should start
thinking now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatible
for everyone, and side-step the clipper stuff and use internet for
all our phone calls in future :-)  [1/2 joking]",11

Is this a figment of your imagination? Here is another one:


 Source: ""Mitteilungsblatt, Berlin, December 1939, Nr. 2 and 5-6""

 Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately 
 forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi 
 collaboration.

 A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft
 is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The 
 magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany
 and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the
 magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,
 is attention-getting.

 This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically
 important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be
 an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind. 

 In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain
 political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They 
 occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.
 The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered 
 ""Aryan"" and what befell them.

I don't want to get into a semantic argument, but contrary to some other
postings ""near UV light"" /is/ ""actual UV light.""  The ""near"" means that
it is close to the visible spectrum (i.e. of relatively long wavelength),
not that it is ""nearly UV.""  (I'm sure you can figure out now just what
""far UV"" is.)

Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the
near end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the
visible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources are
going to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as
fluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV
sources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The
shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.

It wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes
in a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively
cheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough to
be useful, but not dangerously so.",12

"So far Simmons looks like a total idiot.


1) Zane Smith should learn how to ""switchpitch"" and return from the DL. I
would rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.

2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an
impressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's
reputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the
AL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope he
pitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.

3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently.
BUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have
shown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little
bit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.
Merced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at
the plate in his rookie year.

4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that
Walk desrved his contract.

5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I
can't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through
waivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.
Not a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him
way too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught
should have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed
pitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to
trade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere
wasn't very fit last year.

6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!
7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the
season. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other
than the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,
Patterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have
pitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money
on Patterson in stead.

8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.

9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.
10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his
value has increased immensely.

11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.
Let's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.
Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better
than a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.

12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement
in favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that
idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.
13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The
RF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace
two of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a
very respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have
a respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit
left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options
for the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was
getting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.

14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.
they will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.
Now, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,
nothing else will.

On a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2
starts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of
the season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the
season, they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked
in the second half of the last 2 seasons)>

"_MY ADVOCATE_

I sinned. And straightway, posthaste, Satan flew
Before the presence of the Most High God
And made a railing accusation there.
He said, ""This soul, this thing of clay and sod,
Has sinned. 'Tis true that he has named Thy name;
But I demand his death, for Thou hast said,
'The soul that sinneth, it shall die.' Shall not
Thy sentence be fulfilled? Is justice dead?
Send now this wretched sinner to his doom!
What other thing can righteous ruler do?""
Thus Satan did accuse me day and night;
And every word he spoke, O  God, was true!

Then quickly One rose up from God's right hand,
Before whose glory angels veiled their eyes;
He spoke, ""Each jot and tittle of the law
Must be fulfilled; the guilty sinner dies!
But wait -- suppose his guilt were all transferred
To Me and that I paid his penalty!
Behold My hands, My side, My feet! One day
I was made sin for him and died that he
Might be presented, faultless, at Thy throne!""
And Satan flew away.  Full well he knew
That he could not prevail against such love,
for every word my dear Lord spoke was true!

"I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (Vs.
a blank screen) by monitoring the R,G, and B outputs of a graphics
card.  It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at
65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be
able to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)
and a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be
cheap.  

My first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each
compariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input
went to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).

The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I
needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the
compariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my
circuit would not detect it.   

The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then
the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In
fact the difference between completely black and completely white is
only 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the
video signals to make this work.  

There are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require 
split supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator
with three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply
circuit.  

At this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor
circuit.  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...

Unfortunately, I am way out of my league when It comes to designing
transistor circuits, so I am appealing to the net for help.  Any
ideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatly
appreciated.  

Oh yes, I only sample the output of this thing every second or so, so
I don't need a fast response time at all, however, I haven't found a
way to take advantage of that fact.

Thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give. Of course,
you will have my undying gratitude.

directly in either case, but EMX makes OS/2 almost as compatible with
UNIX systems as many UNIX systems are with each other.  And, best of
all, EMX is free.  :-)

There is a similar system (GO32) for DOS, but it doesn't work with
Windows, as far as I know.


Should add in the cost for DOS with both Geos and Windows, neither of
which is a standalone OS at this point.  Neither OS/2 nor UNIX requires

performance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC

to a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.
I have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak

are going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold 
105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges
are cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.
Cost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli

reliable.  Personally, I'm excited by the new drive and look forward to

Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions.
However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faint
ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far
as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within
a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the
center.  (These measurements are statistical, and you can
always hide a sufficiently small number of a different
type of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assuming
that there is only one population of GRBs).

The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the center
of the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact center
of are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets
way beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing
GRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to
be released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models
tend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.

If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy)
you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of
the Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center
(for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if they
are Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in
radius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda
Galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, the
Earth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.


The aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don't
see many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.


There are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature.
Right now, the theorists have a sort of unofficial moratorium
on new models until new observational evidence comes in.

down for three months.
- From memory it has an 80 MB hard drive.
- Manuals and original disks are for SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a
- When powered up, the CMOS was wiped. A technician examined it and 
pronounced the disk drive unusable.

My investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders, 9 sides).
When CMOS set this way, COMPSURF runs happily, with 13 bad blocks.

I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive.

Install will proceed ""successfully"", but when I try to boot the server, it
reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware.

Internal examination indicates that the keycard is present, and there is one

Attempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready
errors.

Questions:
=========
The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen
SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware for level II
(mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes? 

So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?

1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this what
is causing my serialisation error?
2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives, one of
which has failed?
3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not
be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive?
4. What else can cause a serialisation error?
5. What happens if the keycard fails?
6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments
and guides.

up front about this, and about allowing wiretaps.  How is this ""fooling"" 
anyone?


Sure.  The two don't interoperate.  You couldn't talk to, say, a Cylink phone 
from a Clipper phone.  I would expect even multiprotocal phones to come with 
indicators saying which kind of link encryption is in use...

"My mom has just been diagnosed with cystic breast disease -- a big
relief, as it was a lump that could have been cancer.  Her doctor says
she should go off caffeine and chocolate for 6 months, as well as
stopping the estrogen she's been taking for menopause-related reasons.
She's not thrilled with this, I think especially because she just gave
up cigarettes -- soon she won't have any pleasures left!  Now, I thought
I'd heard that cystic breasts were common and not really a health risk.
Is this accurate?  If so, why is she being told to make various
sacrifices to treat something that's not that big of a deal?

Thanks for any information.

    It isn't Apple's responsibility to tell its customers how to fool
around with it's hardware. That is what Apple Service Techs get paid to
do. I personally like the design of the Q800, and applaud Apple for
coming up with a good way to make use of the front space for all of
those drive bays. I like it a lot better than the 900/950 design, except
for those people who need Drive Arrays. I do, however, agree with you
about the LW Pro design.


    Again, its's not Apple's place to make it easy for non-certified
service people to fool around with Apple hardware, even if they did buy
it. Of course you are free to do what you want to your Mac, just don't
get upset when your Apple Service Rep tells you that your warranty is no

    This sounds like the kind of problem I had when I installed 4MB
SIMMs into an LC, back before low-profile 4MB SIMMs were readily
available. The standard 4MB SIMMs would contact the top of the case and
make it a bit difficult to close the LC, but it did close and work just
fine. One of the nice things about Logic-Boards is that they are

    Apple has really confused people with this whole thing. I think
we'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is
no ""option"" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs:
there is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full
'040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA).
And there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other
than the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one
of the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be
getting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't
be able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040.
It's not an ""option.""
    Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s
thinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannot
recognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for
a FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or
something like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to
replace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will not
need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the
full '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.",4

That figure (1/4"") for image rotation would seem to be a little high...
on my NEC 5FG the specs call for no greater than 3mm (0.12"").


I can't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned, they are
adjusted to ""factory-spec"" before leaving the central USA distribution point
(MA) for the eastern Canadian market. Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* that
the >=15"" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over
distances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore
*expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor*
(not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN
Information Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and
probably only way of having any chance of receiving a ""perfect"" monitor
(the definition of ""perfect"" seems to depend on how picky one is, in my
case quite :).


I, for one, was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard
monitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC,
finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, IMHO,
but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying
convince me was ""normal""). The short answer is no, don't accept these
""imperfections"" as ""normal"" because for the premium one pays for the
larger screen monitors, one has a right to expect higher quality, and
if you're persistent, you'll receive it.

[stuff deleted]

Ok, here's the solution to your problem.  Move to Canada.  Yesterday I was able
to watch FOUR games...the NJ-PITT at 1:00 on ABC, LA-CAL at 3:00 (CBC), 
BUFF-BOS at 7:00 (TSN and FOX), and MON-QUE at 7:30 (CBC).  I think that if
each series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd
consecutive nights (I haven't counted so that's a pure guess).

I have two tv's in my house, and I set them up side-by-side to watch MON-QUE
and keep an eye on BOS-BUFF at the same time.  I did the same for the two
afternoon games.

Btw, those ABC commentaters were great!  I was quite impressed; they seemed
to know that their audience wasn't likely to be well-schooled in hockey lore
and they did an excellent job.  They were quite impartial also, IMO.

Tell me Tim, what are these guerillas doing wrong? Assuming that they are using
civilians for cover, are they not killing SOLDIERS in THEIR country? If the
buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel, is it not working? Why is it 
further neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese villages? Why not just
kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone? You see, there is more to
the shelling of the villages.... it is called RETALIATION... ""GETTING BACK""
...""GETTING EVEN"". It doesn't make sense to shell the villages. The least
it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli government for the lives of
civilians.




If Israel is not willing to accept the ""word"" of others then, IMHO, it has
no business wasting others' time coming to the peace talks. 


No, I am not Basil. I think Basil is a very intelligent person and I
respect what he writes. Basil is a person that I would gladly call
a friend. He is, however, not me. Nor am I Lebanese, as some seem to
suspect.
 

Tim, you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been
disarmed. Hezbollah remains the only independent militia. Hezbollah does
not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up
Sheikh Mosavi, his wife, and young son. Of course, if Israel would withdraw
from Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't
make the Lebanese so mad as to do that. Furthermore, with Hezbollah 
subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.


Tim, when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian border?
Not lately, eh?

Israel knows very well that the Syrians are able to restrain ALL who would use
territory under their control to attack Israel. While Lebanon would be better
off with Syria and Israel out of its borders, the presence of Syrian troops
in Lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on Israeli territory (not on
Israeli troops in Lebanon, however. Please note the distinction) in the
past two years.


I disagree, Basil has always seemed to me to be a cool-headed person, slow
to anger (certainly more so than I). What is most important is that he is an 
actual witness to things from the other end of the Israeli guns. If only the 
Israeli government would remember what it was like when the roles were 
reversed perhaps they would moderate their ""retaliation"".",17

Terms are being used in a loaded way here.

""Logical proof"" is an extremely messy thing to apply to real
life. If you think otherwise, try to construct a proof that
yesterday happened. Obviously it did; anyone old enough to be
reading this was there for it and remembers that it happened.
But *proof*? A proof starts with axioms and goes somewhere.
You need axioms to talk about logical proof. You can say that
you remember yesterday, and that you take as axiom that anything
you clearly remember happened. I could counterclaim that you
hallucinated the whole thing.

To talk about proofs of historical events, you have to relax the
terms a bit. You can show evidences, not proofs. Evidences of the
resurrected Jesus exist. Proofs do not.",15

"I was curious to check out how many San Jose Mercury News mentioned
Tyre (1990-92). Here's the outcome from the research (condenced versions,
copyright San Jose Mercury news):

---
  Bombings in the two largest cities in southern Lebanon killed 11 people
and 
wounded 80 others. A car bomb blew up in Tyre, killing 10 people and
wounding 
75. A man was killed and five others seriously wounded in an explosion in 
Nabatiye.
---
  An Israeli navy patrol boat attacked and sank a rubber guerrilla boat off

southern Lebanon early today, killing the two men aboard, the army command 
said.
  
     It said in a communique that a Dvora patrol boat opened fire on the 
motorized rubber dinghy north of Tyre after identifying it as hostile. The
army 
said no one on the Israeli boat was injured. The affiliation of the slain 
guerrillas was not immediately known.
---
  Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind Abu
Nidal 
battled Sunday in Tyre, Lebanon, with machine guns and rocket-propelled 
grenades, killing at least four people and wounding 15, police said.
---
 Lebanon's mainstream Shiite Muslim militia said Thursday that it had 
uncovered a network of tunnels in a southern Lebanese village where it said
pro-
Iranian kidnappers had held Western hostages.
  
     Officials of the militia, Amal, led local journalists through the
catacomb-
like alleys and showed them two cells with iron doors at the village, 
Kawthariyet al Siyad, near Tyre, the ancient port city, about 40 miles
south of 
Beirut.
  
     The officials said they were certain that U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William
R. 
Higgins was detained there shortly after he was seized by gunmen on a road 
outside Tyre in February 1988.

...anyway, I counted 20 articles during these 3 years of reporting. I also
found out the possible reason why the numbers for the inhabitants of the
city is defined between 14000 and 24000. It seems that Tyre is one of the
places
where people from Libanon flee to during more extensive bombings, so
there's
a constant flow of refugees entering and leaving Tyre (articles mentioned
thousands of people entering and leaving this place).

I counted 0 articles for my home town, Kristinestad, so from now I will
consider this place to be a fishing village :-).

"My BBB Autoline arbitration experience is over.  
The outcome was decidedly mixed.  I won the battle but 
lost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was 
defective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below 
market value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average 
retail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but 
the decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the 
Council of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the 
fact that if you have an automobile that does not 
depreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive 
to deal with you.  There is no way that the 
manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and 
sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded 
a repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet's 
representative at the hearing tends to support this 
point of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not 
seem to take the proceeding very seriously.

I decided to take the repurchase, even though I am 
getting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have 
to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon 
myself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on 
the Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to 
my elected representatives telling them how utterly 
ridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for 
a ""use deduction"" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.  
As if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying 
for my insurance.

Summary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton
HD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992 
this vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems 
that required attention included the transmission, 
heater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main 
problem was the five speed manual transmission.  They 
could not install a non-defective transmission in at 
least four attempts.

So, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but 
you are going to get screwed on the price, unless you 
paid too much in the first place, or if your car 
happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.",7

Some thoughts:

Has any work been done on encapsulating encrypted data inside ""non-encrypted""
data files?  Many file formats can be written with ""gaps"" in them to hide
other data.  New file formats could be designed to have alternate data hidden
by dispersing it amongst the ""legitimate"" data.  The hidden data would only
show up with the right key(s), and a file with hidden data would be
indistinguishable from one without.  So, only the correct key(s) would reveal
the presence of an ""illegal"" document.

If I devise a custom file compression algorithm and only I and a friend have
the uncompressor, and otherwise the file appears to be total gigerish, do I
have the right to transmit the file?  Will we have to ""escrow"" all our data
file formats?  Are gangs required to escrow their hand signals, colors and
catch phrases?",11

""Happy the minority [Jews] which has had no Christian nation to protect it.
 And one recalls that the Jews took up their abode in 'fanatic' Turkey

 liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects, all being exposed alike to the
 rapacity of their common rulers. To one brought up, as most Americans have 
 been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of 
 the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious

                TURKEY AND THE HOLOCAUST

An  interview  with  Stanford  J. Shaw  (History),  who  recently
completed  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the
Turkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in
Rescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution,
1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree
program in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for
the Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the
G. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.

Editor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and
European and Turkish Jews?

Shaw: Basically, I'm  an Ottoman historian, but  I'm also Jewish.
I've  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as
time went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews,
I collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a
couple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the
500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and
coming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire
Avenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman
Jewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became
motivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The
Jews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book
is quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who
tend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint
of the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish
sources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I
approach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of
view of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I
finished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across
additional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War
II. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good
deal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not
actually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in
the Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish
diplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It
was too late to add this new information to the book in press, so
I decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research,
mainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the
Turkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second
book, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped
rescue Jews from the Nazis.

- How exactly did they do this?

The story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents
the material in three parts, first of which deals with the period
before the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in
1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi
Germans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and
the like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of
reforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were
being fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new
talent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three
months  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey
arranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and
were   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish
universities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical
personnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors
came to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political
scientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in
Turkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the
Berlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist,
came to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics
in Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the
Nazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually
came to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other
German Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey.
One  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical
producer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to
Turkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the
Turkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul
Hindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first
phase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by
Turkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in
Turkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded
themselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in
the anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I
even  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey
praising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting
the idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been
persecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the
Nazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The
second part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in
1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and
especially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They
had migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of
the century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the
Turkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was
threatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews
throughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might
happen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled
to France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their
Turkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the
Nazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of
anti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not
worth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot
to be a Turkish Jew.

- How so?

Turkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained
its embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries
until it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the
end of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position
to  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the
actions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of
the  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in
particular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from
the Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish
citizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were
arrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats
would  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other
officials and say in effect:  ""These people are Turkish citizens.
You  can't do  this  to  them."" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be
released.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish
diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.

The Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey.
They hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion
of the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and
manganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they
usually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews.
The Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps
to secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded
trains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and
succeeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews
were sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in
Paris,  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish
consuls took place.

The greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned
their  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The
consuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizens
because  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews
lining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get
passports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their
Turkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so
processing the application would take  some time. In the meantime
it was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on
the streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them
if they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because
radios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of
these  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a
document called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  ""irregular fellow
citizen."" The  document said in  effect ""This person is  a former
Turkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his
Turkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if
you  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.""  The
diplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on
it. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they
accepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this
means, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who
had relinquished their Turkish citizenship.

Actually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of
Jews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to
retain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these
interventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all
Jews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to
prevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz
before the Turkish consuls could do anything.

- Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?

There were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War
II,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the
information in this section of  the book relates to the situation
in France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls
sent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in
reply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would
present  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are
Turkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the
Nazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish
consuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from
Nazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran
regularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas
so they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were
often  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern
Europe  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these
governments really didn't want the Jews to escape. As a result of
the Turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish
Jews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to
Auschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either
escaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of
southern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much
better than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy
fell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well.
Incidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also
worked to rescue Jews in that country.

- The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats
acting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin
from Nazi persecution.

Yes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their
interventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their
treaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German
territory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey.
On  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not
discriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis
claimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not
discriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally.
Turkey  protested,   saying,  ""You  are  dividing   our  citizens
according to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that
all  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion.
Therefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews."" American consuls
in  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told
American Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they
couldn't do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were
being treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book
takes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the
Holocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European
Jews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in
Palestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in
Istanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other
Jewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also
sent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These
groups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out
what was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at
that  time people  didn't know  what  was going  on. They  didn't
imagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the
first step was to get information, and the Turkish government let
them use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and
friends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out
what was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the
Nazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received
assistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who
served as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to
1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican
representative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the
Catholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was
doing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern
Europe.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these
agencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even
railroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia,
Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren't able to help much in
Poland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the
Polish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for
the Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the
so called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through
the Black Sea to Istanbul.

Turkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its
borders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was
suffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The
government,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the
non-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by
the Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and
Palestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean
from southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly
opposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did
not want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they
feared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British
constantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic
and send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government,
yielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For
example, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700
Jewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish
government  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British
ambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all
were lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish
government allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to
pass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during
the Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these
refugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to
send money and food out of the country.

- Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be
living in Israel.

Yes, and  their children. But  let's return  for a moment  to the
first group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not
go  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the
non-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en
route to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.

- And you have rescued it from obscurity.

Many studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do
not focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of
the scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of
whom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a
much smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the
picture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to
undertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.

When it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively
small in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The
rescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so
significant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were
murdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.

About  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  -
translations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the
story is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware
of  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the
people of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would
not  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they
could see the documents.

- What languages are used in the documents?

Most of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There
is a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of
the boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I
did not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what
Turkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A
few documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did
not necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in
fact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying
to  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For
example, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency
was  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in
helping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President
Roosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had
been an executive of Bloomingdale's  department store in New York
City, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The
documents related to his mission are in English.

I also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust
historian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His
father was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had
gathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn't
personally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more
can  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone
someday will make the effort.

- This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it?

Right. I'm  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the
Ottoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In
addition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I've been actively
involved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the
coming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I
helped organize  a large international conference  on the subject
which was held in Istanbul in 1992.

- Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken
place, what do you plan to do next?

I'm working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War
for Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the
years  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the
victorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its
independence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid
II, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an
important modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed

Ok I will do this V E R Y  S L O W L Y so you can understand
REGUARDLESS of whether it is a Mac or a PC SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 are DIFFERENT
from each other as is asynchronous and synchronous SCSI-1.  All of these
have DIFFERENT SPEEDS and COSTS. Lumping them all together as 'SCSI' is
dumb and sloppy.  Take again the quote later on as an example of the problem 
in the PC world {The spec list was so that you knew where the numbers were
coming from in the article.  It shows the article is CORRECT in it
staments about SCSI but not CONSITANT}.

With the way this thread has gone how do you tell :-).
Already GAVE them.  YOU keep deleting them! So here are the Specs
on everybody AGAIN {With some added info}:

SCSI-1 {SCSI-1 controler chip} asynchronous range: 0-3MB/s
 synchronous range: 0-5MB/s  Both common to the PC world; difference is
 mainly in software not hardware.

SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 controller chip; also called SCSI-2 (8-bit)}: 4-6MB/s with 
10MB/s burst.  This is advertised as SCSI-2 in BYTE 4/93:159 FOR the
 PC and AT THESE SPEEDS.{NOT the Mac, the PC.}

{I have not seen the following for EITHER the Mac or the PC}
SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst
SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst

On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:
 asynchronous range: 0-5MB/s {infered from BYTE 4/93:159}
 synchronous range: 0-8.3MB/s.

Note that I ALSO give the AVERAGE through put for SCSI-2 which holds true
a Mac OR IBM/PC clone with the correct hardware and software.
And since PC ADVERSIZEMENTS are using Theoretical performance figures WHY 
CANNOT WE?


With PC articles like the following it is obvious that the problem is NOT with
SCSI but with the PEOPLE WHO REPORT IT! {Like YOU.}
Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote: 
(My comments in {})
""Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI,{This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with
a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE..."" {this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with 
a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2} PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29
The ARTICLE is confused, NOT SCSI.  The TERM is a mess from inconsitant use
NOT because the interface itself is a mess.

SCSI means ""The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2""
NOT 'SCSI-1' as some people want to use it.

To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read:
{asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip}
""Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the 
speed of IDE...""
or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2}
""Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as
ESDI, 20% faster than IDE...""

NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity.",3

DEPOSITION OF YURI VAGARSHAKOVICH MUSAELIAN

   Born 1953
   Line Electrician
   Sumgait Streetcar and Trolleybus Administration

   Resident at Building 4/21, Apartment 29
   Block 14, Narimanov Street
   Sumgait [Azerbaijan]


I spent almost all of February doing overhaul. The 27th was a short day at
work, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided
to go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal
Flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had
walked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes
behind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24
Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the 
car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit,
and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and 
her hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to 
45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help
them. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?

When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was, 
but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the 
Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle
around it. I ask, ""What's going on?"" Someone tells me, ""Come listen."" Well
they were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: ""Brother
Muslims, our time has come . . . "" and something else along that line. I
didn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to 
get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter. 
New people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And
the comments started: ""Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!"" and ""There's
no need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us."" I even heard that: ""All 
Moscow is behind us."" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this 
was no joke. I quietly left and went home.

Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh, 
that there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of 
things, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.

My wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku. 
I didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two
o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and 
shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly,
like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a 
demonstration and move slowly.

My wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some
outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd
people are shouting ""Down with the Armenians!"" and ""Death to the Armenians!"" I
waited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street 
on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned 
and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26 
Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there 
was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same 
kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside 
from the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young
people in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.

My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of
uneasy and said, ""No, let's stay at home instead."" An hour went by, or maybe 
an hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say
exactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on
the side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.

I put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside,
and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time 
there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more 
aggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration.
They would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run 
again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I 
followed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was 
leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one 
side, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square 
and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There 
was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.
I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. ""We don't need 
perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been."" Now what did they 
mean by ""living like we have been?"" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else. 
But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense 
of others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just 
in Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it 
anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.

Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians' 
apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't 
hear them say ""kill them"" over the microphone, I only heard ""beat them and 
drive them out."" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then
another are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off
to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and 
I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB.
There were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try 
to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.

Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no
demonstration, and I had to protect my family.

I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next
to the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai-
lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some-
thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because
after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons
in there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City 
Party Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I 
saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the 
cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15 
to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried 
off by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing
right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe 
about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha. 
When I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was 
about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He 
has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I 
have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of 
people smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled 
around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.

Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting. 
I turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am, 
I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags. 
And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the 
street. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag, 
which had ""Ermeni oryum"" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means ""Death to 
Armenians!"" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really
know what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is
Rafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark
blue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His 
family, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on 
Narimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars; 
their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the 
left. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a 
new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son 
was carrying a flag that said ""Death to Armenians!"" I was surprised because 
before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being 
done not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.

Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, ""It's OK, it'll pass, 
they're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up."" Naturally I didn't 
want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And 
this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't 
see where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't 
handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking 
and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and 
hashish to put in a store window!

So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one 
would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again, 
the police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't 
breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time. 
True, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much-
vaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people 
died, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I 
couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be 
specific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of 
Sumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.

When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: ""Let's go upstairs."" 
We went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the 
evening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more.
I stopped at ""The Corner,"" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I 
look and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to 
the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old. 
The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed 
toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person, 
wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as 
though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more 
noise, and the glass was flying again.

We spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor,
there was really no way to defend yourself there.

In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. 
On the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or 
what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the 
bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying 
there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing
you couldn't even see him.

That was on the morning of February 28. Everyone knows the rest.

"The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to
death, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.

Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two
on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the
right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and
went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to
the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he
missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,
reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.

Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that
Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially
behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate
vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with
Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan
who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious
to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as
soon as he realized he had made the catch.

That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry
went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot
of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of
costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled
food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium
officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and
just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,
Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a
tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about 
winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made
the catch.

Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech
wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that
are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any 
that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have
been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility
of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he
is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated
his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is
impossible.

Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what
the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first
nine games.

I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull
hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,
he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.

But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities
of the fan.

"Hi.  According to my always questionable newspaper, there's a silver

  I might suggest giving the management some more mumble time by asking
the very leading question (in two or three parts)
   What are your long term expectations of space market, what projects
specifically are they funding by internal funds and at what levels
and what competition do you expect in this  area. (This last point
is always worth hitting upper management with ""gently"" if you want 
them to think and as hard as you can if you have a good case that
there really is competion)

Is this the joke of the month? 

1. Your fascist grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim people
between 1914 and 1920.

2. Your Nazi parents fully participated in the extermination of the
European Jewry during WWII.

3. Your criminal cousins have been slaughtering Muslim women, children
and elderly people in fascist x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag for the last 
four years.

The entire population of x-Soviet Armenia now, as a result of the 
Genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people, are Armenians. 

For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people 
lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the 
oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutions
culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried 
out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks 
and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their 
homeland. After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands 
were empty of Turks and Kurds. 

The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.

Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and 
Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.

Today, x-Soviet Armenian government covers up the genocide perpetrated 
by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against 
humanity.

x-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide 
against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations 
to the Turks and Kurds.

Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands, to determine 
their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

During the 78th Anniversary, we come once again reiterate the
unity of the Muslim People, the timelessness of the Turkish
and Kurdish Demands and the desire to pursue the struggle
for that restitution - a struggle that unites all Turks and Kurds.

Today, we appeal to all Turkish and Kurdish people in the United 
States and Canada to participate en masse in the Commemorative 
Events, be they cultural, political or religious.

I'd love to know how ""Jesus only"" proponents would answer questions like:

-Who is this ""Father"" Jesus keeps referring to? Why does He call Himself ""the
Son""?

-Why does He pray to the Father, and not to himself?

-Why does He emphasize that he does his Father's will, and not his own?  If He
 was doing his own will, what kind of example is that?  Should we follow it?

-When He says he has to return to the Father, who is He going to?

-When He says he does this in order that the Comforter, the Holy Spirit might
 come, who might that be?

-If He claims that the coming of the Holy Spirit is such a blessing that it's
 worth His leaving us and returning to the Father, what can that mean if there
 is no Holy Spirit?

-Why doesn't the best known Christian prayer begin ""Our Saviour, who art in
 heaven,"" rather than ""Our Father?""

Do they have answers to these questions that are even plausible?

Although, others have in the past and will continue to disagree
i think that it is worthwhile to get an alarm.



I think that it is important to protect your trunk, engine bay, all
doors.  I'd get flashing lights, LED's mounted on the drivers and
passenger door and a relay to disable engine operation. Toss in 
a glass break sensor, and shock sensor. Door lock and unlock,
two remotes and panic feature are also nice to have.

Most important is where you have the installation done!  Some places
may cost a little more, but a poorly installed alarm (no matter how
much it cost) will be a major burden.



IMO, things like engine starters, voice alarms, window/sunroof open
and close, and most other conveniences.

	Tell me, do these young men also attack Syrian troops?



	There must be a guarantee of peace before this happens.  It
seems that many of these Lebanese youth are unable to restrain
themselves from violence, and unable to to realize that their actions
prolong Israels stay in South Lebanon.

	If the Lebanese army was able to maintain the peace, then
Israel would not have to be there.  Until it is, Israel prefers that
its soldiers die rather than its children.



	Israel should withdraw from Lebanon when a peace treaty is
signed.  Not a day before.  Withdraw because of casualties would tell
the Lebanese people that all they need to do to push Israel around is
kill a few soldiers.  Its not gonna happen.



	Why should Israel not demand this while holding the buffer
zone?  It seems to me that the better bargaining position is while
holding your neighbors land.  If Lebanon were willing to agree to
those conditions, Israel would quite probably have left already.
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that the Lebanese can disarm the
Hizbolah, and maintain the peace.

"Read this through once or twice.  Then replace ""prince"" with
""government"" or ""president"", as appropriate, and read it again.  

[From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by
Daniel Donno.]

	In order to keep their lands secure, some princes have
disarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the
cities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against
themselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they
initially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have
destroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite
judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular
circumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall
nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself
will allow.

	To begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince
disarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he
proceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their
arms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal,
while those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they
are transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all,
nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by
extending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of
the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while
the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties
and dangers should receive advantages.  

	When you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by
showing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you
distrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you.
Moreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would
have to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been
discussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be
good enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful
subjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired
state has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is
full of examples proving that this is so.

	But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he
annexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all
the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire
it; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render
soft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of
the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to
his original domain.

	...",11

""fete""??? Since this word both formally and commonly refers to
positive/joyous events, your misuse of it here is rather unsettling.
 

I certainly abhor those Israeli policies and attitudes that are
abusive towards the Palestinians/Gazans. Given that, however, there 
*is no comparison* between the reality of the Warsaw Ghetto and in 
Gaza.  

Just as international law recognizes the right of the occupying 
entity to maintain order, especially in the face of elements
that are consciously attempting to disrupt the civil structure. 
Ironically, international law recognizes each of these focusses
(that of the occupied and the occupier) even though they are 
inherently in conflict.

Israel certainly cannot, and should not, continue its present
policies towards Gazan residents. There is, however, a third 
alternative- the creation and implementation of a jewish ""dhimmi""
system with Gazans/Palestinians as benignly ""protected"" citizens.
Would you find THAT as acceptable in that form as you do with
regard to Islam's policies towards its minorities?
 

It is a race, then? Between Israel's anti-Palestinian/Gazan
""Final Solution"" and the Arab World's anti-Israel/jewish
""Final Solution"". Do you favor one? neither? 

Since there is justifiable worry by various parties that Israel
and Arab/Palestinian ""final solution"" intentions exist, isn't it
important that BOTH Israeli *and* Palestinian/Gazan ""rights""
be secured?

							April  20, 1993
Representative Skaggs,

Recently I wrote to you regarding my outrage over the tactics used by the
Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, (BATF), in Texas.  In your response
you stated that ""Events in Texas underscore the need for stricter gun control
legislation to keep guns out of the hand of groups such as the Branch Davidians.
My question to you is, ""what grounds would you use to deny them access to 
firearms?""  Best I can tell this statement underscores your apparent total
ignorance of the subject, and highlights your personal bias against firearms.
I say this because there are only two possible paths of ""gun control"" which you
could have been referencing.

Either:
1) You were talking about their access to semi-automatics firearms.  In this
case I should point out that semi-automatic firearms are legal in most areas of
this Country, including Texas and Colorado.  In addition the members of the
""cult"" have never been convicted of any crimes which would deny them the ability
to purchase these weapons.  So under what grounds would you deny them these
guns?  Their religion?  The fact they they live in a large group alone by
themselves?  Because you consider them to be a cult?  Maybe I consider your
Church to be a cult!

This line of reasoning by you borders on the concept of ""thought crimes.""  You
and Pat Robertson should really get along.

2) You were referring to the ALLEGED FULLY automatic weapons possessed by the
""cult.""  Under current US law, FULLY automatic weapons have been covered by
some of the strictest gun control laws in this Nation.  So if David Koresh
illegally possessed them, he would have had to circumvent some of the strictest
laws we have.  How will more laws help?  By the way, it has been reported that
David Koresh possessed a Federal Firearms License which would have permitted 
him to possess FULLY automatic weapons.  If true, the 85 people who perished
Monday in the fire, died so that the Federal government could collect a couple
hundred dollars in taxes on guns David Koresh didn't declare.

I have heard claims that they were ""stockpiling weapons.""  Yet considering the
number of people in the complex, even 200+ weapons would not have been out of
line with gun ownership statistics for all of Texas.  What's next?  A siege of
Dallas/Ft Worth for alleged ""stockpiling?""

Face it David Skaggs, You have voted for virtually EVERY gun control law that
has passed through Congress, yet you claim that you are only for ""reasonable""
restrictions.  Bull****!   Handgun Control Inc. is struggling to maintain
250,000 PAID members, while the NRA has just exceeded 3,000,000 members.  They
are still growing at a rate of 2,000 new members per day.  Driving around YOUR
district I see NRA stickers every day.  In eight plus years of living here I
have only seen ONE HCI bumper sticker.  When you vote for your ""reasonable""
gun control laws, are you really representing your district, or are you
representing Sarah Bradys'?

"I am making a search for a CAD program that does a decent job
of making schematic drawings.  The program needs to be in
MS-DOS, Windows if possible.

What I want the CAD program to do is to draw diagrams by
dragging elements onto the screen, and in this the elements
needed are as diverse as vacuum tubes to ICs (case with pins).
It also needs to have provision for adding legends to the
components as well as their values.  In other words I want to
produce quality drawings.  Printout would be to either 24 pin
dot-matrix and/or Laser Printer.

If you know of such a CAD program that is of reasonable cost,
please respond.

In the case of victimless crimes yes, I think so.

Think about it.  If I rob or beat up or rape or kill someone, it's very
clear to anyone not a sociopath that I've done something immoral.  On the
other hand, if I smoke grass or have sex with a consenting adult in a
manner illegal in that state, the morality or immorality of that act is
merely a lifestyle choice; it doesn;t clearly hurt anyone else.  IMO, if
such an act doesn;t hurt another person it should not be interfered with.


I think so.  And I don't use drugs, outside of the legal ones (alcohol
and coffee).",18

A verrrrrry long time, like on the order of days.  I had the pleasure of
doing that once (playing with the speedo cable) and with my B&D heavy duty at
full speed (600 rpm) all the speedo ever got up to was 30 MPH.  Now if you go
a high speed drill and ran it at say 4000 rpm, you could get 200 MPH out of
it.  (If you speedo doesn't burn out.)  Anyways, to roll a 100000 Mile

"I just bought a select 300 and rushed home to print 
some grayscale pictures for my kids, when I discovered that
grayscale(and photograde) are not available if you are
using an SE...even if you are running with an '030 cpu.
You won't see this in the printer's docs, and the Apple
rep didn't mention it to our users group either. It seems
that SE ROMs won't support those ""features"". Okay, I 
guess I should have somehow known that this was the case.
Let the buyer beware, huh Apple?
	Be that as it may, I have been thinking about the 
problem and I'm puzzled. Why  can't a defencieny in the

can't be done"" responses I've gotten from those I have
asked so far.  Isn't Mode32, or somesuch piece of  soft-
ware, just such a fix. 
	Anyway, I was hoping someone knowledgeable
about Mac internals could set me straight: is it simply
impossible for a mac SE to print grayscale, or could
someone armed with enough info and a little pro-
gramming experience cook something up that would
supplement the ROM's capabilities?
	Also, how does one know if one's mac can
support the grayscale and photograde that the Select 300
is supposedly capable of? ( Short of buying the printer

	I agree that a fully-loaded SL2 would come close in price to a
LOWER-END Ford Taurus.  A FULLY-LOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would still
be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2.  A fully loaded
SL2 would run somewhere around $17,000, while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be
somewhere around the $22,000-$23,000 range.  A base Taurus (GL I believe) might
start around $15,000.  Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push $30,000
if you really try, but this is a totally different car than your mainstream
Taurus sedan.  Your statement was not entirely faulty, just a little

Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed
face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular
pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in
the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are
sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else,
one can get too much of a good thing.


Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased
heart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries,
essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency
her, necessarily.



Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not
necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting
occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has
eaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the
list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an
enzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly
ache) would be expected.




These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar
to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious
compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible
some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the
symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets
can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be
necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person
was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration
and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from
simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.
 

People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends
upon what it is about the compound that ""pisses off"" their body.
Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many
people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an
histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard,
causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an
allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that
contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can
perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it. 


See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory
problems are not serious. They can be deadly.

and brain damage. 

The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system
controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling
the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin,
and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.


poisoning. 

Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating ,
say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus
too much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home,
plus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days
before from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of
things.

But it might be the MSG. 


If noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably
stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.


Anyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their
responses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.",13

Flights of fancy, and other irrational approaches, are common.  The crucial
thing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use
unless they make you do some experiments.  I've known a lot of scientists
whose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit
out loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.

(Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA
electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that
he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic
genes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out
binding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence
that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for
Warren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in
so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into
the genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were
much elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was
recognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created.
Other species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me,
Warren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)


I'm not sure that it's random.  But there is no known rational mechanism
for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really
working in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense
of what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best
thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong,
you will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_.
If you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all
in mind, you will probably get nowhere.


Unfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to
non-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science:
Lysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.


I don't agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at
which I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the
culture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing
process.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.

Another point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental
design''.  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,
not design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for
bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously
been found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny
nose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage
was well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.


It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps
you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out
for perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first
advanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are from
modern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole.",13

of self-defense, perhaps we start putting the arm on police; maybe
we should start demanding that police are only police when ON-DUTY,
that after that they are just like the ordinary disarmed helpless
chumps they consider ""civilians.""

Let's prohibit arms carrying by police when off-duty. Or, if they make
the assertion that ""Well, I need to maintain my gun"" let's make it
regulation that they can carry an UNLOADED firearm home, that it's
only fair that they be just as helpless as poor schmuck coming home
from his computer operator job...

"Two developments have brought these type of activities back to
the forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a
20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from
the Mir Space Station.  While this ""Banner"" reflector was blank,
NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner
reflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-
based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV
commercial, as filmed from the Mir.
   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the
same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga
booster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the ""Environmental
Billboard"".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the
University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the ""Environmental
Billboard"" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to
804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,
deployed by the inflatable 'frame'.
   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for
maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry ""ozone reading
sensors"" to ""continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's
delicate protective ozone layer,"" according to Mike Lawson, head of
SMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum
exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth's
atmosphere. According to IMI, ""as the biodegradable material burns,
it will release ozone-building components that will literally
replenish the ozone layer."" The remaining spacecraft will monitor
the atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns
up and ""adds to the ozone supply.""
   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several
millions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI
estimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who
watched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost
$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being
promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996
Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
  
But back to Brian's questions:
  
    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my
estimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus
$10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming to
tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for
optimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon
someone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated
launch.  That's a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.
    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as
well.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use
of launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think the
legal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,
and no, I don't really like the idea of this additional light
pollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal
challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive
aspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the
advertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change
positive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the
space advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an
idiot?)
   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a low
enough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would
only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before
dawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just
after dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the time
of worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still
be a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)
    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There
were about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga
advertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for
only a $500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious funding
for this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking
for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I
am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.
  
   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be
my guest.  I don't have posting privileges to that area (or at least
I don't THINK I do...).

I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine, not the network
itself. To give you a real-world example, here at Quarterdeck we have
roughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novell
file servers, and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on our
Ethernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on each
segment). If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to run
were very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns.

But the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486
33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have
10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdowns
because you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX will
attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time
slice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it.

Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding
in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of
thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before
you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).
It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going
to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all
doing network things also...)",5

Sorry to disappoint you but the Red Wings earned the victory...easily.

I watched most of the game on ESPN (as soon as I realized that they

The Maple Leafs were flat.  Very flat.  Meanwhile, the Red Wings were
skating very freely and dictating the pace of the game.  I didn't
detect any bad penalty calls (Van Hellemond did his usual good job).
Toronto looked like how I expected them to for their first playoff

Sorry.   Wrong.    This is how banks got started in the first place.
Sooner or later your father and his pals will lend money to someone

what it is that they need to quantify risk, and to persuade borrowers

protesters asking them to re-consider shopping there -- how 
is that different from the abortion protesters asking women

""harassment"" (which it is not), hate speech laws have

I sure hope so. Because, the unspeakable crimes of the Armenians must 
be righted. Armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of 
Urartus, massacred and exterminated its population and presented to 
the world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian civilization.

All reliable Western historians describe how Armenians ruthlessly
exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly people of 
Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the 
Ottoman Empire between 1914-1920.

It is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaborators
of the Nazis during World War II and that, even today, criminal/Nazi
members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigate
racism, hatred, violence and terrorism among peoples. 

And x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following 
ways:

1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide
in order to shift international public opinion away from its political
responsibility.

2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism 
Triangle and criminal/Nazi Armenians, attempts to call into question the 
veracity of the Turkish Genocide.

3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through
the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to 
silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.

4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet
Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through
terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters
of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.

Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian government 
is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from
making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.

Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian government and its terrorist
and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle 
of those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the Armenians,
the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and 
consequently a number of governments and organizations have become 
supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.

A professor of mine once said ""The difference between a Computer Engineer and

the CS.
Seriously though the main difference is that most CS people write programs that
people will use, i.e. database, graphics, word processors, etc., while an
engineer writes for machines or control systems, i.e. the ""computer"" in your
car, a flight control system, computer controled devices, etc. In other words
CS writes SOFTWARE while CSE writes FIRMWARE. 
These are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is.",4

every new computer technology was actually lower and slower then what it

were slower then  existent single processors.

What the argument was, though was that these new technologies promised either
theoretically future higher performance  or lower cost or higher densities.

Ted, you're missing a vital point.  As Roger Lustig pointed out in a
previous response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was
because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on
a constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,
on the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.
 If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a
different story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to
hire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is
an admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets
game at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from
baseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion,
that's downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start
suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time
under whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining
to play a three-on-three game.  Now, honestly, if you truly analyze the
differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, I
would think that you'd reconsider your thoughts.

Yes, but as has been mentioned many times before, the Islanders play at
the talent level of their opponent.  Since Hartford is pitiful, the
Islanders played pitiful.  Since Pittsburgh is great, the Isles will most
likely play great.  This is most likely due to inexperience and very poor
shooting.  To Greg: yes, I have noticed that the Islanders couldn't hit
the broad side of a barn with the puck if they were two feet in front of
it.  Does anyone have shooting percentages?  I don't know if that would
help, since they often miss the net completely, but it might shed some
light on the subject.

I bought a Viewsonic 17 for use at home but after a week I took it back.  I 
felt for the money my NEC 5FG that I use at work was a much better monitor.
The NEC is sharper, flatter, less distorted, and more stable.  I have heard 
complaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control 
problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all.

There was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not 
match up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the 
frequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that 
the NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter 
and the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable 
pincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness 
when I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the 
controls.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the 
raster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome 
as the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.

I have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold 
through OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that 
way at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has 
my vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if 
it's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to 
buy.

I have no experience with the Nanao.  I can never keep the Nanao models 
straight and don't have any place I can walk in to get a good comparison of 
all models.

I have a cheap solar charger that I keep in my car.  I purchased it via
some mail order catalog when the 4 year old battery in my Oldsmobile would
run down during Summer when I was riding my bike more than driving my car.
Knowing I'd be selling the car in a year or so, I purchased the charger.
Believe it or not, the thing worked.  The battery held a charge and
energetically started the car, many times after 4 or 5 weeks of just
sitting.

Eventually I had to purchase a new battery anyway because the Winter sun
wasn't strong enough due to its low angle.

I think I paid $29 or $30 for the charger.  There are more powerful, more
expensive ones, but I purchased the cheapest one I could find.

I've never used it on the bike because I have an E-Z Charger on it and
keep it plugged in all the time the bike is garaged.",8
":
 (lots of stuff about the Nicene Creed deleted which can be read in the
  original basenote.  I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to
  take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive
  word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS 
  netters will be amiable in their explanation.)

Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin
of the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say ""no good""
because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not 
the authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time 
before I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England, 
Professor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the 
following as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring 
1993 edition):

  ""I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--
  or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other 
  with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian 
  or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around
  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude
  those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central
  defining characteristic of a good American might be ""one who doesn't draw
  exclusive circles"" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the 
  central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to
  draw a circle around ""Mormon"" or ""Christian,"" to decide who is ""orthodox""
  and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider
  that the central pillar of Christ's ""orthodoxy"" is our ability to love
  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.

  ""I recently spent some time in a ""Christian"" bookstore in California. The
  service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and
  well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural
  commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.
  But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking 
  others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American
  culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to ""Cults and the
  Occult,"" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same
  rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found
  I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers
  (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous
  anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations
  of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).

  ""It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to
  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (""Perfect
  love casteth out fear,"" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the
  LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a 
  disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the
  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive
  action---as the ""religious right wing"" has launched this year against the
  political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like.
  It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the
  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,
  if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of
  others they believe to be evil.""


The above ""sermon"" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe
to This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who
rely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His
arms.  

Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles 
of the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim 
perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do 
now lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled ""Christian"", if 
those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are 
intollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical 
scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication 
than mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the 
majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective 
voice is louder.  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand
on in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter 
the LDS Church' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths 
and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to 
disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves. 
Let us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion 
and conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.

We're probably stuck, as Mike Burger pointed out that the baseball
deal was made far in advance of the NHL contract.  WABC did the same
thing; they were thankful that the Devils were wiped out by 9:30,
because they had to switch over to Yankees baseball.  The proof of 
the reasons for this is left to the reader ...

It's too bad, but I wonder if ESPN is stuck with other US local team
coverage for their alternate games?  We got NESN's coverage of the
Bruins-Sabres with the Boston homers ... they were awful!!!  I've read
that Derek Sanderson is the colour analyst ... I wonder if he spent
his early years after hockey as an intern at PRAVDA before landing
this job?  *Everything* had to be twisted into something good to say
about the Bruin(s) involved ... not even Bill Wirtz's shills on SC
Chicago (Pat Foley, Dale Tallon) were this bad.  And just to be fair,
SC used to take their feed from ESN (Empire Sports Network), the Sabre
homers and they were horrible too ... but they were spacy.

From the CNN highlights, I hear Chris Cuthbert's voice from the CBC
coverage of the Habs-Nords series.  Too bad that we couldn't get it
on ESPN, with all due respect to the Sabres and the Bruins.

No,it didn't. The Israeli army is still the most important army in the midlle

American who will claim the opposite,I can only remember the CNN broadcasting

I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned
examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on (it has been a
couple of years since my Con Law class in college so I hope I am not
missing something obvious here...)

Basic Scenario:

	I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of
	files on disk.  The general setup is designed so that when users 
	connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public
	key and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the
	one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The
	result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it
	is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the
	machine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed
	system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal
	private keys during the authentication sequence.

Questions:

	Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any
	information useful for a search give me any protection as far as
	being coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)

	It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am
	assisting in ""entrapment"" (the users would send thier key anyway
	and are not being enticed into doing something they would not
	otherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?

	Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?

Any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...

I agree with this assessment.  Furthermore, its promotion as
providing greater protection than bare voice is quite true, as far
as it goes.  However, the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal
of letting LE wiretap ""terrorists and drug dealers"" is to restrict
stronger techniques.  

Wiretap targets presently use strong encryption, weak encryption, or
(the vast majority) no encryption.  The latter two classes can be
tapped.  With weak encryption in every phone, the no-encryption
class is merged into the weak-encryption class.  Will the
introduction of Clipper cause targets presently enjoying strong
privacy to give up on it?  that is, to rely for privacy on a system
expressly designed to deny it to people like them?  I doubt it.  The
mere introduction of this scheme will give the government *nothing*.

The stated goal of preventing the degradation of wiretapping
capabilities can be fulfilled by restriction of domestic
cryptography, and only by this restriction.  ""Clipper"" appears to be
no more than a sop, given to the public to mute any complaints.  We
would find this a grossly inadequate tradeoff, but I fear the public
at large will not care.  I hate to even mention gun control, but
most people seem to think that an `assault weapon' (as the NYT uses
the word) is some sort of automatic weapon, .50 caliber maybe.  Who
wants to have such a thing legal?  Well, people know even less about
cryptology; I suspect that strong cryptography could easily be
labeled ""too much secrecy for law-abiding citizens to need"".


What they say is opinion, but what they do is what matters, and will
continue unless overturned.  And the courts are reluctant to annul
law or regulation, going to some length to decide cases on other
grounds.  Furthermore, Congress can get away with quite a bit.  They
could levy a burdensome tax; this would place enforcement in the
hands of the BATF, who as we've seen you really don't want on your
case.  They could invoke the Commerce Clause; this seems most
likely.  This clause will get you anywhere these days.  The 18th was
required because the Supreme Court ruled a prohibitory statute
unconstitutional.  In 1970 Congress prohibited many drugs, with a
textual nod to the Commerce Clause.  The Controlled Substances
Act of 1970 still stands.  I think the government could get away
with it.

Assuming 68HC11...
In expanded muxed mode, you *could* do it. Much easier if you get a DRAM
controller IC. The MMI 673102 could be used to implement this, or you
could use a counter and a huge multiplexer to provide row/column/refresh
address multiplexing. The thing with DRAMs is that they require wierd
timing, address multiplexing, and refresh.

Actually, if you wanted to use a 68008 IC, you could look at AN897, which
has a neat controller built in. There is also the 683xx, I think one
of those has the DRAM controller built in. This one is for the 6664
DRAM, however, the 41256 has only one more address line, adding only
another component or so. The 256k SIMMs are basically 8 or 9 41256
DRAM chips (or their equivalent in fewer packages).",12

  The commercial uses of a transportation system between already-settled-
and-civilized areas are obvious.  Spaceflight is NOT in this position.
The correct analogy is not with aviation of the '30's, but the long
transocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  It didn't require gov't to
fund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit
at the destination.  In practice, some were gov't funded, some were private.
But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount
of money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff.
  I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop,
and large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth.  But if you ask
me for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, I
can't give them.  We just don't know enough.  The launch rate demanded by
existing space industries is just too low to bring costs down much, and
we are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industries
will be, when they will practical, how much will have to be invested to
start them, etc.

From the limited details released so far, It seems that the clipper chip 
system must employ some sort of public key cryptography. Otherwise, the key 
management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system 
unworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place
at the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in 
their data base?

This means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key 
algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI. The former is 
rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making
chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the feds
are forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that 
could break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.   

As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to
ban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it. Their contention that they 
need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key
registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likely
is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont 
have the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in their Q&A session, they
talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but
carefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed.
They seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without 
court order even though tapping a phone line requires one. Also pick up on 
their implicit threat of eithe accept this or we'll ban strong crypto outright?
I dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all (legal) ways

": In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a
: reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. 

I'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is
interpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on
the values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such,
is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human
activity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or
ethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure
from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.

: If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must
: first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering
: the meaning of the word ""objective"" I doubt that this will ever happen.

: So, back to the original question:

: And objective morality is.....?

This may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory.
Objective in the sense used here means something immutable and
absolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of
people. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The
concept supposedly described may have meaning however. 
If there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then
He has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His
existence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this
being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has
defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,
He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically
self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an
objective sense.
If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.
If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that
standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative
morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,
meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to
misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to
meet that standard is therefore objectively determined.
Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is
infinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself
doesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural
norm, or the preferred conduct of ""decent"" people, making it seem
subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.
Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true
nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being
contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due as",19

intervention, in Bosnia has not been well thought out by those who 
advocate such action. After the belligerants are subdued, it would require
an occupation force for one or two generations. If you will stop and
think about it, you will realize that these people have never forgotten
a single slight or injury, they have imbibed hatred with their mother's
milk. If we stop the fighting, seize and destroy all weapons, they will
simply go back to killing each other with clubs. And the price for this
futility will be the lives of the young men and women we send there to
die. A price I am unwilling to even consider.


There is no valid comparison to the Holocaust. All of the Jewish people
that I have known as friends were not brought up to hate. To be wary of
others, most certainly, but not to hate. And except for the Warsaw
uprising, they were unarmed (and even in Warsaw badly out-gunned).
It is very easy to speak of muscle when they are someone else's muscles.
Suppose we do this thing, what will you tell the parents, wives, children,
lovers of those we are sending to die? That they gave their lives in some noble cause? Noble cause, separating some mad dogs who will turn on them.

Well, I will offer you some muscle. Suppose we tell them that they have
one week (this will give foreign nationals time to leave) to cease
their bloodshed. At the end of that week, bring in the Tomahawk firing
ships and destroy Belgrade as they destroyed the Bosnian cities. Perhaps
when some of their cities are reduced to rubble they will have a sudden
attack of brains. Send in missiles by all means, but do not send in
troops.


By all means lift the embargo.


Which killers? Do you honestly believe they are all on one side?",17

Benedikt,

I can't recall anyone claiming that God -makes- anyone act a particlar
way, I think that you're attempting to manufacture a contradiction.
God is said to require certain behavior, but the only compulsion is
the believer's sense of duty. A standard of conduct does exist, but we
are free to ignore it or misunderstand it or distort it in whatever
ways we find convenient, but our response to God's edicts can in no
way be used to question God's existence. The behavior of believers is
a completely separate question from that of God's existence; there is
nothing contradictory here.

To say that something defined contadictorily cannot exist, is really
asking too much; you would have existence depend on grammar. All you
can really say is that something is poorly defined, but that in itself
is insufficient to decide anything (other than confusion of course).

Your point that there are better reasons for the phenomenon of belief
than the object of belief may lead to a rat's nest of unnecessary
complexity. I think I know what you're implying, but I'd like to see
your version of this better alternative just the same.",0

"# #Slavery makes economic sense (it NEVER makes MORAL sense) when human
# #muscle power is an economically valuable asset. Agricultural slavery might
# #have lasted right up to the first mechanical cotton reaper, but no
# #further; reapers are cheaper than slaves, and don't have to be fed during
# #the winter. 
# 
# This argument makes a several fundamental errors.  First ""agricultural""
# slavery was not limited to production of cotton.  In the American south
# slave labor was used extensively to grow tobacco, sugar, and rice, all
# of which remained labor intensive enterprises well into the 20th century.

And of course, in states like Kentucky and Virginia, not well-suited to
large-scale plantations, slave labor was used to make one of the most 
valuable agricultural products of all: more slaves.  In some ways, this
treatment of humans beings as breeding livestock is the most horrifying
aspect of American slavery.

# Second, although mechanization of cotton production could be expected to
# reduce the demands for labor eventually, it was only in the 1940's 
# the mechanization of cotton production in the South largely eliminated
# the labor intensive character of the operation, long after the ""first
# mechanical cotton reaper"" was invented.

This is an interesting question.  Steinbeck's _Grapes of Wrath_
(published in the 1930s), uses agricultural mechanization of cotton
production in Arkansas as the cause of the Joad family being evicted
from the land.  How many years were involved in the mechanization of
cotton farming?  When did this first appear?

Pardon me for being a little confused, but at the beginning of your second 
paragraph, you say, ""God has one set of rules for all his people,"" yet at the 
end of the same paragraph you declare, ""please do not combine the ceremonial 
and moral laws in one.""  Not only do I not understand where in the Bible you 
find the declaration that there are 2 laws (ceremonial and moral), but I am 
also unclear on whether you think it is bad to have 2 sets of laws in the first 
place.  If it's bad to have 2 sets of laws, how can there be a ceremonial law 
that is different from the moral law (and vice versa)?

I would also be interested in your comments on the passage in I Cor. 10:1-16, 
where Paul teaches different rules for covering you head while praying 
depending on whether you are a man or a woman.  Do you think the apostles can 
prescribe different sets of rules for men and women?  If so, then why not for 
Jews and Gentiles?  Also, why did Paul, who was so opposed to circumcising 
Gentiles, voluntarily circumcise Timothy?",15

But,
 THEY FACED THE PHILLIES -- A TEAM THAT GOT OFF TO AN 8-1 START.




  To be honest, I think the city of Houston loves the new owner.  He has
brought baseball back to Houston with key acquisitions -- players that
were from the Houston area and wanted to play for the Astros.  I don't
think that too many people are fearful that McLane will meddle in the team
as he has already admitted that he doesn't know a whole lot about baseball.
McLane is a businessman, and doesn't like excuses.  He makes a valid point
that injuries shouldn't be an excuse to this club.  Look at the depth of the
bench this season.. Canadele can play 7 positions; Bass and James are solid
outfielders and can hit well too; Uribe is nice to have as well..  The
pitching staff has 6 legitimate starters.  We're dealing with a young
Houston team, so injuries shouldn't play a big role.  The only threat is
the bullpen -- if Jonesy goes out, we may be in trouble but with the
type of starters we have this season, there is less pressure on the pen.",9

Just an comment:  I don't like it when people decide what's good for me...
If you think you're going to decide anything for me, you'd better be 
carrying a badge and a gun.  Who made you capable of determining if there
is ""no way in hell that anybody is going anywhere""?  Why do you find 
it necessary to add to the problem instead of just minding your own 
business?  If someone is minding their own business, I will give them
all the room they want, and I'll try to make things easy for them, even
letting them in in front of me if they ask politely (with a directional).
On the other hand, if someone like you decides they want to block me and
be a general asshole, you can bet your ass that I'll make life as 
miserable as possible for you, as long as it doesn't affect anyone else
who's minding their own business.  
They have a phrase to describe someone like you:
Self Appointed Traffic Police.
Just mind your own business and stay in the right lane where you belong.

I am told that Planned Parenthood/SIECUS-style ""values-free"" methods, that
teach contraceptive technology and advise kids how to make ""choices"",
actually _increase_ pregnancy rates. I posted a long article on this a while
back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The
article included sources to contact for information on research verifying
these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring
abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.

The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula
were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is
reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy
rate.

The difference is not in ""contraceptive technology"" but in the values taught
to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have
legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that
they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the
values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of
these kids.

Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are
suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that
desired.  

Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't
we teach ""safe drug use"" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it
because we know that a class in ""how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to
use drugs"" would increase drug use?  Why isn't ""drug abstinence education""
barred from schools because it teaches ""religion""?  Aren't we abandoning
those children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safe
use?

X    10th International Obfuscated C Contest
X
X	""The original obfuscated contest""
X
X    Obfuscate:  tr.v.  -cated, -cating, -cates.  1. a.  To render obscure.
X                b.  To darken.  2. To confuse:  Their emotions obfuscated
X		their judgment.  [LLat. obfuscare, to darken : ob(intensive) +
X                Lat. fuscare, to darken < fuscus, dark.] -obfuscation n.
X                obfuscatory adj.
X
X    GOALS OF THE CONTEST:
X
X        * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below.
X        * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.
X        * To stress C compilers with unusual code.
X        * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.
X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-)
X
X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since
X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that simply works
X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add
X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language.
X    (see ""The New Hacker's Dictionary"" by Eric Raymond)
X
X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before
X    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email
X    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may
X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical
X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not
X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical
X    closing date for contests are in early May.
X
X    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to
X    year.  You should be sure you have the current rules and guidelines
X    prior to submitting entries.  To obtain them, send Email to the address
X    above and use the subject 'send rules'.
X
X    One may obtain winners of previous contests (1984 to date), via ftp from:
X
X	host: ftp.uu.net	(192.48.96.9)
X	user: anonymous
X	pass: yourname@yourhost
X	dir:  ~/pub/ioccc
X
X    As a last resort, previous winners may be obtained by sending Email
X    to the above address.  Please use the subject 'send YEAR winners',
X    where YEAR is a single 4 digit year, a year range, or 'all'.

X                         Alena Lacova (alena@nikhef.nl)
X
X    A  contest of  programming skills  and  knowledge, exclusively  for the
X    PostScript programming language. Its purpose:
X
X    * To spread knowledge of PostScript and its details.
X    * To applaud those with the best tricks.

X      their own game by writing  the most obscure and mysterious PostScript
X      programs ever.
X
X    Winners will receive the fame and attention that goes with having their
X    program entry posted as a winner to programmers world-wide.
X
X    The 1993 contest rules and results are available by ftp as
X    ``wilma.cs.brown.edu:pub/postscript/obfuscated*.shar'', or individually
X    in the obfuscated directory. The judges will post the 1994 rules
X    in November to comp.lang.postscript on Usenet, and other places.
X    Send questions to jgm@cs.brown.edu.
X
X    Categories include: Best Obfuscated PostScript, Best Artwork,
X    Most Compact, Best Interactive Program, Most Useful, and
X    anything so unusual and creative that it deserves an award.
X
X    The judges will choose the winners of each category.
X
X    Alena Lacova  is a system  administrator at NIKHEF  (Institute for High
X    Energy and Nuclear  Physics) in the  Netherlands. She is  the author of

No, VL-bus IDE is no faster than ISA IDE.  The IDE interface is
fundamentally nothing more than an extension of the ISA bus, and if
you hook it to VL-bus it'll work as fast as the slower of the two,

No.

In what still, IMHO, ranks as the all-time greatest PR blunder (not to
mention on-ice blunder) the Whalers ever committed, GM Eddie Johnston and
Coach Rick Ley 'decided' that Francis was incapable as a leader and stripped
him of the Captain's ""C"" in December of 1990. The whole organization (read:
EJ and Ley, and by default owner Richard Gordon because he was too much of
a dupe to know how much he was being blind-sided by EJ) dumped on Francis all
season, starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract, publicly 
humiliating him, stripping him of the ""C"", and then trading him that Spring
to the Penguins. Classy guy, that EJ.

The loss of Francis (and too a lesser extent, Ulf), was one of a series of
decimating player moves by EJ which stripped the personality and fan-awareness
from the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in today.

[Gratuitous good EJ note...he did preside over the organization when it
acquired Verbeek, Cassels, Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, etc. He stripped the
roster but he DID lay a foundation.]",10

This deserves framing.  It really does.  ""[Atoms] aren't even real.""

most evidence at the moment.",19

Actually, they won't.  What they'll tell you is that if you add up the
number of suicides, murders of one drug dealer by another, legit
self-defenses of a battered spouse, and so on, you'll end up with a
number that is much larger than the number of self-defense killings
against strangers committed in the bedroom.  (BTW - they didn't
honestly count the latter either, but let's not quibble.)  They
try to claim that comparison is between the costs of self-defense
and the benefits, but they're wrong.

This comparison doesn't measure the costs of self-defense and it
doesn't measure the benefits either.  For example, the goal is not to
kill the attacker, whatever your relationship to him, but to stop him.
While the number of killings may be proportional to the number of
stops, it isn't equal.

Anyone who confuses that comparison with an honest evaluation
is either lying or....

  Complete Q700 are best obtained from your dealer or some recent
copy of MacWorld or MacUser.  My foggy memory suggests that the most relevant
comparison factors vis-a-vis a IIci are as follows:

  25 MHz 68040
  16 Mhz data path (don't recall this for sure, but it's slower
      than Q 950 style machines for sure).
  Ethertalk card on-board
  Audio in/out
  4 MB RAM on motherboard
  4 SIMM slots
  2 NuBus slots.
  More flexible build-in video than the CI.  Uses VRAM.

In comparison, a IIci with an accelerator won't give you
  audio or ethernet  or the same video options.
  With a 68040 accelerator, CPU performance can be comparable but I
  think it ends up costing more.",4

        CRYPTO '93  -  Conference Announcement & Final Call for Papers
............................................................................

The Thirteenth Annual CRYPTO Conference, sponsored by the International 
Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR), in cooperation with 
the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, 
the Computer Science Department of the University of California, Santa 
Barbara, and Bell-Northern Research (a subsidiary of Northern Telecom), 
will be held on the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara, 
on August 22-26, 1993. Original research papers and technical expository talks 
are solicited on all practical and theoretical aspects of cryptology. It is 
anticipated that some talks may also be presented by special invitation of the 
Program Committee.
-------------------------        
INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS:  Authors are requested to send 12 copies of a 
detailed abstract (not a full paper) by April 26, 1993, to the Program Chair 
at the address given below. A limit of 10 pages of 12pt type (not counting 
the bibliography or the title page) is placed on all submissions. Submissions 
must arrive on time or be postmarked no later than April 21, 1993 and sent by 
airmail in order to receive consideration by the Program Committee. It is 
required that submissions start with a succinct statement of the problem 
addressed, the solution proposed, and its significance to cryptology, 
appropriate for a non-specialist reader. Technical development directed to 
the specialist should follow as needed.
-------------------------        
Abstracts that have been submitted to other conferences that have proceedings 
are NOT eligible for submission.

Submissions MUST BE ANONYMOUS. This means that names and affiliations of 
authors should only appear on the title page of the submission; it should 
be possible to remove this page and send the papers to Program Committee 
members. A Latex style file that produces output in this format is available by email from the Program Chair.

Authors will be informed of acceptance or rejection in a letter mailed on 
or before June 21, 1993. A compilation of all accepted abstracts will be 
available at the conference in the form of pre-proceedings. Authors of 
accepted abstracts will be allowed to submit revised versions for the 
pre-proceedings. A revised abstract should contain only minor changes and 
corrections to the originally submitted abstract. All revised abstracts must 
be received by the Program Chair by July 16, 1993. THE 10 PAGE LIMIT WILL BE 
STRICTLY ENFORCED for the pre-proceedings.

Complete conference proceedings are expected to be published in Springer-
Verlag's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series at a later date, pending 
negotiation.

        CRYPTO '93  -  General Information  (August 22 - 26, 1993)
............................................................................

THE PROGRAM:  Crypto'93 is the thirteenth in a series of workshops on 
cryptology held at Santa Barbara, and is sponsored by the International 
Association for Cryptologic Research, in cooperation with the IEEE 
Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, the Computer 
Science Department of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and 
Bell-Northern Research (a subsidiary of Northern Telecom). The program 
for the workshop will cover all aspects of cryptology. Extended abstracts of 
the papers presented at the conference will be distributed to all attendees 
at the conference, and formal proceedings will be published at a later date.

In addition to the regular program of papers selected or invited by the 
program committee, there will be a rump session on Tuesday evening for 
informal presentations. Facilities will also be provided for attendees to 
demonstrate hardware, software and other items of cryptographic interest. 
If you wish to demonstrate such items, you are urged to contact the General 
Chair so that your needs will be attended to. The social program will include 
hosted cocktail parties on Sunday and Monday. In addition, there will be a 
beach barbecue on Wednesday evening. The price of the barbecue is included 
in the room and board charge, and extra tickets may be purchased.

ABOUT THE CONFERENCE FACILITIES:  The workshop will be held on the campus of 
the University of California, Santa Barbara. The campus is located adjacent 
to the Santa Barbara airport and the Pacific Ocean. Accommodations are 
available in the university dormitories at relatively low cost for conference 
participants. Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to stay in the 
dormitories, so those bringing small children will need to make separate 
arrangements in one of several nearby hotels. More information on hotels is 
enclosed. Parking on campus is available at no cost to the participants. 
However, participants must indicate on the registration form if they desire 
a parking permit.

TRAVEL INFORMATION:  The campus is located approximately 2 miles from the 
Santa Barbara airport, which is served by several airlines, including 
American, America West, Delta, United, and US Air. Free shuttle bus service 
will be provided between the Santa Barbara airport and the campus on Sunday 
and Thursday afternoons. All major rental car agencies are also represented 
in Santa Barbara, and AMTRAK has rail connections to San Francisco from the 
north and Los Angeles from the south. Santa Barbara is approximately 100 miles 
north of Los Angeles airport, and 350 miles south of San Francisco.

REGISTRATION:  Participation is invited by interested parties, but attendance 
at the workshop is limited, and pre-registration is strongly advised. Late 
registrations, subject to a late registration fee, may be accepted if space 
is available, but there are NO GUARANTEES. To register, fill out the attached 
registration form and return to the address on the form along with payment in 
full before July 9, 1993. Campus accommodations will be available on a first 
come, first serve basis for attendees who register by July 9, 1993. The 
conference fees include participation in the program and all social functions, 
as well as membership to the IACR and a subscription to the Journal of 
Cryptology. The room and board charges include dormitory lodging and meals 
are available to those unable to obtain funding. Applications for stipends 
should be sent to the General Chair before June 4, 1993.

It would be nice if, as you rightly point out the inherent value of
freedom of speech, discussion would also deal with the all-to-
frequent ritualized abuses and distortions of that freedom that do 
occur. There are situations where a few extremely vocal, and 
usually radical, people **do** drive people away, effectively stifle
all other (""opposing"") views and generally ""take over"". *Clearly*,
the purpose behind such actions is *to deprive* others of *their*
freedom of speech through overt and covert coercion and domination of 
the ""media form"" in question. While ""freedom"" of speech is to be valued,  
this is not. How would you suggest that this sort of reoccuring problem be

is great enough to be worthwhile. At the same time I'll be buying a new

	I originally wrote to the person who asked this question
personally, but decided to post the information I had on the topic.

	I spoke to the pastor of my parish (Catholic) recently, 
by coincidence, on this subject.  His explaination was that 
while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence
of a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the 
Church as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church 
recoginizes itself as a community of believers, members
of the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable
to each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical
couple on the desert island, there are many places in the
world that do not have priests availible for marriages
on a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without
the priest being present, but get the priest to testify to
their marriage when one comes through the area.  

	I remember a religion teacher in high school saying
that the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple
as much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus,
married couples have some responsibility to the community
to stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the
community.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with
one another--the community should be able to rely on that 
couple to be as one.

	While couples may marry without witnesses, they 
may NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An 
anulment is simply an admission of the church that what
they had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage
at all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting married
in the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves
anulments a half-hour later!!

	I tend to agree with the response back there that
said couples become married as soon as they consumate their
marriage, but I would add that couples should consider their
marriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they
intended to be married, assuming they were both willing
partners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared
to raise any children they may have as a result of that
sexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS a
commitment, I believe, in God's eyes.

	But I'm digressing....

They can make recomendations for you. That's your best bet. Check a biker

It's possible there are no other tires available though.

David,

  As an economist, I'm sure you can see the flaws in this logic. If the (naive)
market is flooded with proprietary, but weak, encryption, then truly strong 
encryption will be unable to compete. Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcast
standard, and then sold TVs below cost. Private industry has a better standard,
but it's not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the market
with cheap proprietary sets. Even though the industry's technology is better,
the programming is being broadcast to the govt's unduplicatable standard.
Who could compete?

  The other flaw, of course, is that making something voluntary today ensures
that it will be voluntary in the future. I went to renew my CA drivers license
last week and was required not only to give my SSN, but to PRODUCE AN SSN
CARD to veryify the number!  Note that a federal law once said that no state
or local govt could ever require the use of SSNs for drivers license registration
(specifically!).

   I do not trust the govt that says ""trust me on this even though we could
have an arrangement that doesn't require your trust.""  Something is big
time fishy. If you look more carefully, you'll see it.

I'm sure it is, and I am not amused.  Every time I read that part of the
TIFF spec, it infuriates me- and I'm none too happy about the
complexity of the spec anyway- because I think their ""arbitrary but
carefully chosen number"" is neither.  Additionally, I find their
choice of 4 bytes to begin a file with meaningless of themselves- why
not just use the letters ""TIFF""?

COD is fine until the buyer opens the box to find they paid 150.00
for a brick. Or if it the seller allows for a personal check to be used
on a COD it's fine till a stop payment is made. There are few methods
to protect both buyer and seller in any sort of transaction. Even with
merchants and customers there are problems...stolen credit cards, 
chargebacks, no return policies and getting the wrong item, etc.

About the only protection available to to do business with someone you
trust....someone who has been around for a while.

Well said, Michael!

The Catholic traditon has a list of behaviours called the Spiritual 
Works of Mercy:

admonish the sinner
instruct the ignorant
counsel the doubtful
comfort the sorrowful
bear wrongs patiently
forgive all injury
pray for the living and the dead (yes, I know there is some controversy 
                           on this and I don't want to argue about it.)

These are all things that have a direct application to usenet.  People 
ask questions and express doubts.  Some are in need of comfort or 
prayers.  Imagine what would happen to flame wars if we bore wrongs 
patiently and forgave injuries.   I would add that it is probably more 
appropriate to do any admonishing by private email than publicly.",15

There are, but not any that would help Texans: In many states,
such laws have been found to violate the state constitution. 
But the federal Second Amendment does not apply directly to the
states. It was written to limit the federal government only. 
The Fourteenth Amendment was written to extend the restrictions
of the Bill of Rights to the state level. However, the exact
wording of the Fourteenth Amendment is very vague. The Supreme
Court has been dancing around the issue without facing it
directly for over 100 years. In practice, the Bill of Right
(indirectly applies through the Fourteenth) applies to the
state governments only if the Supreme Court has ruled that 
particular provision. The Court has made no such rulings on
the Second Amendment.",16

So what's your point?  Mark's comment still is valid.  To suggest that
AIDS is ""deserved"" IS ludicrous.  I sin.  I can resolve to abstain from 
sin, and do weekly (more often, actually).  Yet I routinely fail.
I surely do deserve what I get, yet God compassionately provided 
the Incarnate Logos, Jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation.
If AIDS is deserved, I surely deserve instant death just as much, as do
we all, as St. Paul so cogently remids us.

To willingly judge ""others"" as deserving punishment seems to me
to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility.  
 

So what's the point here?  I can get AIDS and NEVER engage in
""deviant"" sexual behavior.  In fact, I could engage in LOTS

infected.  AIDS is a consequence of particular behaviors,
many of which are not sexual.  And not all sexual behaviors
carry the risk of transmission.

The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.

Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really
why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance
in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT
has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude
lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American
doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple
(early March).

Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French
and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is
it because too many people take French and German in college to make
the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance.
Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when
the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors
were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength
rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized
medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.


For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why
certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't
make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance
rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical
monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they
must move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking
of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the
U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis
E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.

Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's
health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one
small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.


Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany
case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public
sector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra
insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward
accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal
benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be
covered for basic care.

At that point, they wouldn't even consider a ""voucher"" approach
to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up
the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.


It is ""free"" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two
things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like
real health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when
working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying
for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my
pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only
annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal
naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for
that is part of their brainwashing agenda.

The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer 
1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance
coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 
1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%
afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private
hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital
rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same
cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid
out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.
Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,
the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not
gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and
private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that
yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.


Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its
just that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada
and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because
there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.

When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the
risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe
amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on
the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat
themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec
last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against
any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's
public health insurance plan.

jubilee, Pope >Leo the 12th had a medallion cast with his own image on
one side and on >the other side, the Church of Rome symbolized as a
""Woman, holding in >her left hand a cross, and in her right a cup with
legend around her, >'Sedet super universum',  'The whole world is her
seat.""

	You read more into the medal than it is worth.  The Woman is the
Church.  Catholics have always called our Church ""Holy Mother Church""
and our ""Mother.""  An example would be from St. Cyprian of Carthage, who
wrote in 251 AD, ""Can anyone have God for his Father, who does not have
the Church for his mother?""
	Hence the image of the Church as a woman, holding a Cross and a Cup,
which tell of the Crucifxition of Our Lord, and of the power of His
Blood (the grail legend, but also, more significantly, it shows that
""This is the Cup of the New Covenant in my blood, which shall be shed
for you and for many."" (Luke 22.20), the Cup represents the New Covenant
and holds the blood of redemption).  The fact that the woman is holding
both and is said to have the whole world for her seat, is that the
Catholic Church is catholic, that is universal, and is found throughout
the world, and the Church shows the Crucifixtion and applies the blood
of redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers, thorugh which the
Holy Sacrafice of the Mass, can be said and celebrated in all the
nations as Malachi predicted in Malachi 1.11, ""From the rising of the
sun to its setting, my name is great among the gentiles, and everywhere
there is sacrafice, and there is offered to my Name a clean oblation,
for my Name is great among the gentiles, says the Lord of hosts.""  And
so we acknowledge what St. Paul wrote ""For as often as you eat this
bread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death until he comes."" (1
Corinthians 11.26)

	You are quite right about the identification of ""Babylon the Great,
Mother of all Harlots"" with Rome.  I think we simply disagree as to what
time period of Rome the Apostle John is talking about.",15

As has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_
and _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is
described in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications
do indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be
accepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and
reasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.

But people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy
reasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a
large part of the history of science.

There are a couple of negative points to make here:

1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct
verification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted
part of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What
would be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical
reality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could
lie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of
experimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.

(I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.
I don't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less
a theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it
is hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather
directly verifying the existence of qi.)

2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational
experiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and
interpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical
controversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,
there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,
petty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which
computations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical
function of science: results don't count unless they can be replicated.

The whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate
part can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.

Pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;
but even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;
that when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate
polarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was
indistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur's irrational motivation had
led to a replicable, and important, result.

This is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not
even produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their
theories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not
concede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress
the results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they
think supports their position (creationists).",13

"Tigers' manager Sparky Anderson gets his 2,000th career win as moments ago,
the Tigers completed a two game sweep over the Oakland A's at Tiger Stadium
by beating the A's 3-2. Here are the highlights:


				R    H   E    
             Oakland		2    9   0
	     Detroit            3    7   1

Chad Krueter scored Skeeter Barnes from 1st with an RBI double in the 
bottom of the ninth against none other than Dennis Eckersley to give the
Tigers the victory.  Barnes also had an RBI single to score Thurmond to
tie the score in the ninth, also off Eckersley (sp?).

The A's got their runs on an RBI single by McGwire in the 1st and a solo
homer by Reuben Sierra in the 6th.  Deer doubled home Kirk Gibson in the
7th for the other Tiger run.

John Doherty pitched another strong game for the Tigers, once again lasting
through the seventh inning.  He was relieved by Bolton and then David Haas
in the 8th, and Haas got the win.  Bobby Witt started for the A's, and was
replaced by Honeycutt in the 6th, followed by Goose Gossage in the 8th, and
finally Eckersly in the 9th.  Doherty gave up both of the A's runs, while
Witt gave up the first Tiger run and Eckerseley gave up the last two.

In the post game interview (on WJR radio in Detroit), Sparky Anderson said
its one of the few times he's gotten emotional in his managing career.  It
was a big moment for him, and I'm sure all of us Tiger fans are unanimously
very happy for him.  And what a way to get number 2,000!.

Considering the circumstances, I think it might be appropriate to say:

":      Hello, 
: 
:    Let me introduce a problem:
: 
:    When I measure a sinusoidal wave (voltage) with a digital voltmeter, using 
: AC mode, my output is an rms value (a peak value over 2 squared). / Right? / 
:    When I measure a square wave in the same mode (AC), my output is equal 
: to a peak value, actually, to the upper flat boundary of the wave.
:    I assumed, that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the 
: input value, and divides it over the wave period. / Right?/
:    Now, I used it to measure the same  square wave as above, but distorted 
: by high-frequency harmonics. Ideally, output should be the same, but...
: The output value was only about 10% of the previous one! 
:    Why? What is the nature of this output value? What does the voltmeter 
: actually measure? And what does it show?  


Re: RMS readings

Unless the DVM *says* it's measuring RMS, it's probably Average voltage.
The input is diode rectified and measured as DC.  If it says it's RMS
and but measures square/triangle/etc.  incorrectly, it's measuring
average and multipling by a correction that's *only* true for sine waves
(i.e.  Vave*(0.707/0.63) = Vrms).  If you want correct RMS for (most)
any waveform, you need a ""True-RMS"" DVM/DMM which literally does the
Root-Mean-Square calculation in either analog or digital circuitry.

: 
:    Related question (less important to me):
:    What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with 
: analog ones? 

The last significant advantage of analog (IMO) ** was ** being able to
""see"" the signal if it was changing over time (e.g.  checking
electrolytic capacitors).

Anymore, most DMM have bargraphs, etc. that duplicate this.

************************************************************

The Event:

* The Joliet Mud Turtles, a Chicago land four wheel drive club, is
  sponsoring an On/Off Road Rally Sunday April 25th.

* For those who ask ""What is an on/off road rally?"", well...

  An On/Off Road Rally consists of the following:

   1. An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of
      directions and clues guiding participates around the 
      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course
      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will
      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which
      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the
      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately 
      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is 
      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points
      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions
      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,
      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.

   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants
      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.
      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles
      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half
      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle
      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will
      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified
      4x4s can run the course.
     
  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring
  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.
  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.

* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles
  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be
  street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section
  of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper
  from their vehicle :) .

The Particulars:

* Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.
    (815)436-9382   (see map below)
* Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m.
* Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine
* There is an entry fee of $10 per truck.
* You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed)
* A valid drivers license is required
* Suggested equipment:
      CB Radio
      Compass
      Tow Strap and Clevis
      Clip Board and Pencil
* No alcohol during rally

Another CPR Non-Fact.


Actually, they are free to leave and seek work in Egypt, except that
the Egyptians don't want them, either.  And who are you going to blame
if/when Gazans establish their own state of Gaza/Palestine?


Actually, one such Jew who did risk his life to help Gazan Arabs was
hacked to death by Palestinean murderers just last week.  It seems
that the risk has been primarily from the Arabs ""in need of help"". 

This is also true for telephone repairmen, traders who seek to buy
agricultural products from Gazans, Israeli soldiers who get involved
in fighting between feuding Palestinean groups that are as determined
to destroy each other as they are to destroy outsiders...

From _Cycle_World_ magazine (5/93) (who usually never says _anything_
bad about any motorcycle):

""The Max certainly has motor, but there are some things it is short of.
It is short of chassis.  It loves straight lines; aimed in one, it is
nicely stable.  But it is not overfond of corners.  Forced into one, it
protests, shaking its head, chattering its front tire, grinding its
footpegs, and generally making known its preference for straight
pavement.  Bumps?  It doesn't like them either.  Its fork isn't too bad,
though it is soft enough that it can be bottomed under hard braking.
The shocks, though which work on that short-travel, shaft-drive
swingarm, are firm to the point of harshness.""

Pardon me Tim, but I do not see how it can be possible for the IDF to fail
to detect the presence of those responsible for planting the bomb which
killed the three IDF troops and then later know the exact number and 
whereabouts of all of them. Several villages were shelled. How could the IDF
possibly have known that there were guerrillas in each of the targetted
villages? You see, it was an arbitrary act of ""retaliation"".



The problem, Tim, is that the original reason for the invasion was Palestinian
attacks on Israel, NOT Lebanese attacks. 


First, I believe that my statement applies to both sides.

Having said that, I think it is neccessary to separate what is legitimately
negotiable and what is not. For example, no country has the right to abuse
one's human rights. Deciding whether there will be one or two states in
Palestine is a legitimate question. While de facto one state exists, Israel 
must treat all within its domain equitably.


Yes, I am afraid that what you say is true but that still does not justify
occupying your neighbor's land. Israel must resolve its disputes with the
native Palestinians if it wants peace from such attacks.


Not true. Lebanese were not attacking Israel in the 1970s. With a strong
Lebanese government (free from Syrian and Israeli interference) I believe
that the border could be adequately patrolled. The Palestinian heavy
weapons have been siezed in past years and I do not see as significant a
threat as once existed.",17

If it were my wife, I would insist that a radiologist be involved in the

"Hello all,

On my bike I have hazard lights (both front and back turn signals
flash).  Since I live in NJ and commute to NYC there are a number of
tolls one must pay on route.  Just before arriving at a toll booth I
switch the hazards on.  I do thisto warn other motorists that I will
be taking longer than the 2 1/2 seconds to make the transaction.
Taking gloves off, getting money out of coin changer/pocket, making
transaction, putting gloves back on takes a little more time than the
average cager takes to make the same transaction of paying the toll.
I also notice that when I do this cagers tend to get the message and
usually go to another booth.

My question, is this a good/bad thing to do?

Any others tend to do the same?

They do. According the the Los Angeles Police Department, illegal
manufacture is one the three primary sources of machine guns and
submachine guns used in crimes (sumggling and theft from the
police and military being the other two.) Washington D.C. police
have stated that 40% (If I'm remembering the figure correctly) of
the guns they conficate were illegally built.


It takes about 6 hours and a few tools to make one (at least one
of reasonable quality). Unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing
around on a lathe (say, as a hobby), he's going to have to 
pay someone anyway. Materials plus six hours of a machinist's
time for something legal would run about $100. The blackmarket
prices for guns are usually in the $50 to $200 range (at least
those few I've seen cited in newspaper articles were...)


Washington D.C. has a total ban on handguns and prohibits assembled
rifles within city limits. It's homicide rate is almost ten
times the national average. It is also illegal for a D.C.
resident to drive to the Virginia or Maryland suburbs and
buy a gun (dealers are required by federal law to check IDs
and make sure the buyer isn't from another state) so the ban 
can not be easily side-stepped.


Sure. But it you couldn't buy one, you would write your own (in
fact, people _did_ write their own 15 years ago...) More likely,
you would find a friend who was a particularly good programer
and get him give you a copy of his. Software is a _very_ bad
example for your case: How many people do you know with illegal
copies of $400 word processors? If people want something, and
it isn't available (or affordable) legally, they will usually
get it illegally.


Quite.


13-3-2. The formula has been around for half a million years.
Or are you going to restrict sales of sulpher, charcoal and
saltpeter? That's alot cruder than modern smokless powder, but
it works very well. The only real problems are a ~25% reduction
in energy (so a .357 magnum would ""only"" be as deadly as a 9mm)
and it makes alot more smoke... Of course, a smart black marketeer
could just make the gun in 9mm and steal the ammunition from the
police (the police are often corruptable, and things are known
to disappear from police evidence rooms and armories and
reappear on the streets...)

"Dear Xperts,

I'm developing an application that uses a Motif slider to select
an image file out of a directory. Now I would like to display the
name of the file corresponding to the value of the dragged scale
button (i.e. with the MB1 pressed). As XmNshowValue only displays
the current value of the scale button and not the actual corresponding
image file name, I thought of using an XtAddEventHandler to do
the mapping between the scale value and the file name:

XtAddEventHandler(scaleImage,Button1MotionMask,  FALSE, SliderMoved, NULL);


and in the eventhandler do a:

  while (XCheckTypedWindowEvent (display, event->window, MotionNotify, &Return))
   ;
  XmScaleGetValue(scaleImage,&value);
  /*map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open*/


However, when I move the pointer in the scale widget I get callbacks, with of co
   urse
a null effect as my MB1 is not pressed to move the scale button. So what is goin
   g wrong?

Well, some quick math on my part shows that an 8.3MHz bus, 16 bits
wide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3M
bytes/sec.  Someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles to
perform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5MB/s,

Is it appropriate for the Lord not to reveal certain 
things before the world (i.e., publish them widely)?

These things sacred to Himself.  He may place any 
pre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary.

Moreover, there are precedents in scripture where
knowledge of sacred things is withheld:

1. After the Transfiguration Jesus instructed
Peter, James, and John to ""tell the vision to no 
man, until the Son of man be risen again from 
the dead"" (Matt. 17:9).  
If we were living at the time of Savior, there
would be no (public) record of this event.

2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision 
of ""paradise"" when he ""heard unspeakable words, 
which it is not lawful for a man to utter""
(2 Cor. 12:4).
This person heard something which Paul can not 
write to the Corinthians (and us).

3. There is an incident recorded in the Book of
Mormon where words uttered by ""babes"" were 
""forbidden that there should not any man write
them (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text follows
for those of you without access to the BOM).

3 Nephi 26:16
Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the 
multitude gathered themselves together, and they
both saw and heard these children; yea, even 
babes did open their mouths and utter marvelous
things; and the things which they did utter were
forbidden that there should not any man write them.

Some LDS scholars speculate that these words
which could not be written are the sacred
portions from temple we are to withhold from 
the world (but it could be something else).


There is much we can discuss about the temple 
ordinances.  We can discuss regarding baptisms
and other vicarious ordinances for the dead.
We can discuss certain concepts regarding the
endowment (""the ritual"").
However, there are certain elements I can not
discuss with anyone (including other saints)
outside of the temple.
As a portion of the endowment, we receive the
tokens and signs that will permit us access
to Heaven.  I must keep this knowledge sacred 
and respect the conditions under which it is
revealed to me.",15

ONLINE AND OTHER SOURCES OF IMAGES, DATA, ETC.


INTRODUCTION

    A wide variety of images, data, catalogs, information releases, and
    other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net.
    A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the
    remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as
    providing 'anonymous FTP'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on
    the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP
    directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via
    email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
    or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions
    on how to make requests.

    The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames
    SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.

    Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is
    huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.


VIEWING IMAGES

    The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly
    large, and I won't attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To
    read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,
    use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu
    (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP
    sites.

    The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image
    formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document
    is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at
    pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory
    pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.


ONLINE ARCHIVES

    NASA AMES

    Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via
    anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and
    a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press
    releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please
    note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.

    FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in
    pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the
    archive (the index is about 200K by itself).

    To access the archives by email, send a letter to
    archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the
    subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:

	send SPACE Index
	send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.

    The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in
    caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use
    one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this
    section for images or programs.

    The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image
    disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The
    disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are
    available in these collections.

    The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory
    contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in
    the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is
    found in the IMDISP directory (see the item ""VIEWING IMAGES"" below).

    The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to
    contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing
    specific information. It's in MISC/media.guide.

    Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee
    (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).


    NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM

    The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and
    provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data
    from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140
    data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can
    be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS
    also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition,
    ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to
    query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors,
    keywords, title words, or abstract text words.

    ADS use requires direct Internet access. For more info and to sign up to
    become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu. The User's Guide and
    ""QuickStart"" Guide are available by anonymous FTP to sao-ftp.harvard.edu

    NASA SPACELINK

    SpaceLink is an online service located at Marshall Space Flight Center
    in Huntsville, Alabama. The system is specifically designed for
    teachers. The data base is arranged to provide easy access to current
    and historical information on NASA aeronautics, space research, and
    technology transfer information. Also included are suggested classroom
    activities that incorporate information on NASA projects to teach a
    number of scientific principles. Unlike bulletin board systems, NASA
    Spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers. However it
    does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments
    for NASA which may be answered by regular mail. Messages are answered
    electronically, even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by
    mail. Messages are generally handled the next working day except during
    missions when turnaround times increase. The mail system is closed-loop
    between the user and NASA.

    SpaceLink also offers downloadable shareware and public domain programs
    useful for science educators as well as space graphics and GIF images
    from NASA's planetary probes and the Hubble Telescope.

    You can dial in at (205)-895-0028 (300/1200/2400/9600(V.32) baud, 8

    NATIONAL SPACE SCIENCE DATA CENTER (NSSDC)

    The National Space Science Data Center is the official clearinghouse for
    NASA data. The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.
    Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.36.23) and
    log in as 'NODIS' (no password). You can also get the catalog by sending
    email to 'request@nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov'.

    You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,
    no parity, one stop). At the ""Enter Number:"" prompt, enter MD and
    carriage return. When the system responds ""Call Complete,"" enter a few
    more carriage returns to get the ""Username:"" and log in as 'NODIS' (no
    password).

    The system is menu-driven; topics available as of 3/93 are:

	1   -	Master Directory - NASA & Global Change
	2   -	Personnel Information Management System

    ASTRONOMICAL DATABASES

    The full SAO stellar database is *NOT* available online, probably due to
    the 40 MB size. It may be ordered on magnetic tape from the NSSDC. A
    subset containing position and magnitude only is available by FTP (see
    ""Astronomy Programs"" below).

    nic.funet.fi (128.214.6.100) has a large collection of astronomical
    programs for many types of computers, databases of stars and deep sky
    objects, and general astronomy information in directory /pub/astro. This
    site is mainly for European users, but overseas connections are
    possible.

    The Ames archives contain a database of 8,436 galaxies including name,
    RA, declination, magnitude, and radial velocity in MISC/galaxy.dat.
    Supplied by Wayne Hayes (wayne@csri.utoronto.ca).

    iris1.ucis.dal.ca (129.173.18.107) has a number of GIFs from Voyager,

PLANETARY MAPS

    The USGS address for maps of the planets is:

    U.S. Geological Survey,
    Distribution Branch,
    Box 25286, Federal Center, Bldg. 41
    Denver, CO 80225

    Maps cost $2.40 to $3.10 per sheet (a few come in sets of 2 or 3 sheets).

    The best global maps of Mars based on Viking images are 1:15,000,000
    scale in 3 sheets. These maps are:

    I-1535 (2 sheets only) - relief, albedo, names
    I-1535
    I-1618 (3 sheets) - relief, names
    I-2030 (3 sheets) - relief, topographic contours
    I-1802-A,B,C (3 sheets) - geology

    There are many other maps as well: 30 sheets at 1:5,000,000 scale in
    relief, albedo, geology, photomosaic forms (not all 30 sheets available
    in all formats); 140 sheets at 1:2,000,000 scale as photomosaics of the
    whole planet, about 100 sheets of interesting sites at 1:500,000 scale
    in photomosaic format, and lots of special sheets.

    Then there are maps of Mercury, Venus, the Moon, the four Galilean
    Satellites, six moons of Saturn and five of Uranus. [Phil Stooke

COMETARY ORBIT DATA

    The Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams and the Minor Planet
    Center announce the sixth edition of the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits in
    IAU Circular 4935. The catalogue contains 1292 entries which represent
    all known comets through November 1989 and is 96 pages long.
    Non-subscribers to the Circulars may purchase the catalogue for $15.00
    while the cost to subscribers is $7.50. The basic catalogue in ASCII
    along with a program to extract specific orbits and calculate
    ephemerides is available on MS-DOS 5.25-inch 2S2D diskette at a cost of
    $75.00 (the program requires an 8087 math coprocessor). The catalogue
    alone is also available by e-mail for $37.50 or on magnetic tape for
    $300.00.

    Except for the printed version of the catalogue, the various magnetic
    media or e-mail forms of the catalogue do not specifically meantion
    non-subscribers. It is possible that these forms of the catalogue may
    not be available to non-subscribers or that their prices may be more

about 200,000 people.  Funny, I don't see 200,000 people out there,

"Could someone email me a USNail address for the NRA? I'd like to write them
a letter encouraging them to see to it VERY EMPHATICALLY that the 2nd
amendment is restored to the form that the founding fathers intended.

People like Howard Metzenbaum seem very intent on diluting the 2nd amendment
to the point where it is no effort for the governmentski to do what they
did in Waco.

After all, from what I know of the Federalist papers, it is this kind of
tyranny the 2nd amendment was supposed to be designed to protect against.

Honestly! M-60 tanks against the civilian population! Attack helicopters!

We need the right to keep and bear anti-tank weapons. Actually, if they
intend to mass armour against the (weakly-armed, at that) civilian population,
we need the right to field tactical nukes. Government tyranny! Who would
have ever thought it would happen here!

I wonder who'se house they'll run tanks through next, because the gov.
SUSPECTS child abuse. Maybe yours! Maybe mine!
And what is an Illegal Weapon (which they have yet to show us), if the
2nd amendment is designed to do what I believe it is, and the gov. uses
tanks against you? Government self-serving? Naaaah. Not here.

Time was when the U.S. used armour/attack helicopters against small countries.
Now, we're down to using them against to what amounts to a busload and a
half of civilians.

It still applies, except the astronomy these days is Very Long Baseline
Radio Astronomy coupled to GPS and Satellite Laser Ranging. The data
from NASA's and the Naval Observatory's (among others) is a vital 
source of data for studies into crustal dynamics, Earth rotation, and
purturbations. Every time there is a leap second added to the New Year,
remember the military and science are still co-habiting nicely. The
same VLBI was used to track Gallileo as it passed the Earth, and used
so little fuel that it can afford to observe Ida.

Is the license required for driving a car exclusively on private
property, such as a farm? Here in the United States, the license
is required only for the use of public roads.


We also have a nation of 250 million people, _many_ issues and
usually only two candidates for a given office. A President
might be willing to abuse mild gun control laws and create
a de-facto ban (something a majority of the people would object to)
and still be elected: The voters might look at issues like the
civil rights of minorities, health care, etc... and vote
for the ""lesser of two evils."" I don't think this is a matter
of paranoia, since local governments in (for example) New York
and Chicago have abused existing, mild gun control laws to 
create a virtual ban.


In which case, the United States already has adaquate gun control laws:
According to federal statistic, only 7% of gun-wielding criminals
legally purchase their own guns from licensed dealers. If that's
the point of gun control (to prevent criminals from legally purchasing
guns) then America doesn't need any additional laws to accomplish
this.


How is this any different from guns? There are legal purposes for
owning and using a gun: They are appropriate tools for hunting,
target shooting and self-defence. Like cars, murder isn't
their only (or even a common) use.


I certainly couldn't imagine the American public accepting regulation
of axes. While the politics of other nations may be different,
in America there is strong opposition to any intrusive law that
primarily would effect the average, law-abiding citizen who had
not done anything wrong.


A good way to deal with which problem? It is an excelent way to deal 
with the short-term problem of rioting and violent attacks. Of course,
it doesn't do anything for the long-term issues that start riots. But
at this point, what can these individuals do about long-term social
problems? 


There are, according to surveys, guns in 40% of American homes.
In many parts of the country, this is closer to 100%. Those places
where almost everyone owns a gun are, on average, safer than those
where guns are less common.


This is, I think, a fundamental difference between American government
and that of other nations. Here it is not acceptable to punish
or restrict the average, law-abiding citizen in the name of some
vague ""common good."" ",16
"I HATE long postings, but this turned out to be rather lengthy....


Overall Crime rate:
It fell....just like that...

Acquiring weapons in Norway:
You can buy (almost) all kinds of weapons in Norway, BUT you must have a 
permit, and a good reason to get the permit....
If I would like to have a handgun, i would have to get an gun-licence from 
the police and to be a member of a gun-club.
The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes and/or
records of SERIOUS mental diseases.
Now, if a got my licence, I would have to be an active member of the gun
-club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun.
It's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ???
You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...

Use of guns in crimes (in Norway):
Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms'
for a long time, but these are rather the exeption.
Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short 
time befor the crime.

Use of knives:
It IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or 'open'.
You (Americans) think it's ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open
in public -rigth ??

Scandinavians ARE 'aggressive':
We northeners are not as hot-livered as southeners, but when we decide
to take action we DO.
Ask ANY historian or millitary with an knowledge of europe....
(Or ask any German who served in Norway in WW2.....)

Individual vs masses:
Yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some
extent....
Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ??
What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of 
all the others ??


The issue:
I believe the issue is GUNS, and gun-legislation.
We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one....
IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.
But should it have to be like that ??
Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??
If you believe it's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think
it should be free to buy guns ??

Disclaim-her:
I'm not a pacifist or anti gun. 
I would defend my home, loved ones and country, but I don't view guns as
neccities or toys.
I HAVE done army service, and HAVE used a variaty of weapons, but wouldn't
want to have one for self defence or because they 'feel good'....

Unfortunately your phrasing is ambiguous.  Re-writing more carefully, we have
(at least) two possibilities.  The first:

Things called ""Mercedes"" are cars
That girl is called ""Mercedes""
Therefore that girl is a car

That is entirely valid as a piece of logical deduction.  It is not sound,
because the first statement is false.  Similarly, I would hold that Jim's
example is valid but not sound.

Another possible interpretation of what you wrote is:

There exists at least one car called ""Mercedes""
That girl is called ""Mercedes""
Therefore that girl is a car

what makes a storage tube work is a screen placed just *behind* the phosphor,

With the trace now written to the screen, a separate low-level ""flood""
electron gun keeps the image lit by exciting those areas of phosphor
which are next to the ""written"" areas on the storage screen.  There are
some problems with this - the resolution is limited compared to a non-storage
tube, and the stored trace tends to ""bloom"" with time. 

Of course, this is pretty much obsolete technology, done in by the current
digital scopes which use raster-scan displays and keep everything in a
frame-buffer memory anyways.

Do you question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,
Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?   Their documents
have decayed to dust too.  Brian, why another excuse? 


Peter wrote a bit of the Bible.  What Peter says about God is what
the Bible says.   


Consider the Bible a court recording.  Over the period of thousands of
years, various people come up and testify of their experience with the
living God.  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up comes Moses,
once the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah, a priest.  Up comes
David, a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King 
Nebuchanezzar.  Up comes the pagan King of Persia, Cyrus.  Up comes
Nehemiah, cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IRS agent
takes the stand.  Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who use
to kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Up
comes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself.
Up comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRS
agents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of years
with people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself
""I am."" 

While you are listening to all this stuff, you realize that
King David could have never known John, Solomon could have never known
Matthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all these
people are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yet
all of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tells
of his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience is
different, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenly
reveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God.
What Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official of
Babylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a different
perspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony
dares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness's
testimony, even though different from those prior, consistently
describes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.  

Now.  As we stare gazing at the computer, you got this seeming fanatic
on the other end of the net, saying, I know this God  ""I am"".  He has
revealed himself to me too.  He also calls himself Jesus (John 8:58).
Please believe me.  I am telling the truth.  It is wonderful to know him.",19

"I'm writing an X server for some video-generation equipment.  The
hardware is ""truecolor"" in YUV space; in X terms it has a 24-bit
static color visual.  I would really like to have the server just
present this static visual, but I'm not sure if this will be 
acceptable to ""most"" X clients.  The three problems I see are:

  1) The colormap, though huge, is static.
  2) All pixels would be 3 bytes wide.
  3) Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space, the
     translation RGB->YUV will introduce some rounding error.

Being more of a server guy than a client guy, I ask: will these
limitations thwart many X clients?  Or will most of the X stuff
floating around blithely accept what they're given?  I could write
the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of, e.g., 8 bits, 
but I'd rather avoid this if not necessary.

I know there are no absolutes, but I'd appreciate hearing people's
opinions and suggestions.  Thanks!
",5
"
We tried to ship an X server once that only supported a 24bit
TrueColor visual. The main problems we encountered were:

	1) Clients written with logic like the following:

	    if (DefaultDepth() != 1)
		/* Assume default depth is 8bit */

	   These clients need an 8bit deep visual in the root window
	   to run correctly.

	2) Other clients didn't even bother to do that much, and just
	   outright assumed they had a *dynamic* visual class, with a
	   dynamic colormap. XStoreColors doesn't work on cmaps
	   associated with Static or TrueColor visual classes, but
	   many clients don't bother to check, they just start
	   throwing XStoreColor calls at you.

Though both are clearly client error, this is the case with so many
clients that it's easier for you to expose 8bit PseudoColor as a
default root window visual, than it ever would be for all these client
writers to change their clients to do the right thing.

"It seems to me that many readers of this conference are interested

My name is Elias Davidsson, Icelandic citizen, born in Palestine. My
mother was thrown from Germany because she belonged to the 'undesirables'
(at that times this group was defined as 'Jews'). She was forced to go
to Palestine due to many  cynical factors. I have meanwhile settled in
Iceland (30 years ago) and met many people who were thrown out from
my homeland, Palestine, because of the same reason (they belonged to
the 'indesirables'). These people include my neighbors in Jerusalem
with the children of whom I played as child. Their crime: Theyare
not Jews. My conscience does not accept such injustice, period. My
work for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism
and racial discrimination. Those who protest against such practices
in Arab countries have my support - as long as their protest is based
on a principled position, but not as a tactic to deflect criticism
from Israel. The struggle against discrimination and racism is universal.

The Center for Policy Research is a name I gave to those activities
undertaken under my guidance in different domains, and which command
the support of many volunteers in Iceland. It is however not a formal
institution and works with minimal funds.

Professionally I am music teacher and composer. I have published 
several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in Europe.

This is indeed one function, but more sophisticated ones do level control

The ground-lift switch disconnects the GND line from the mixer. The
transformer ratio depends on the precise application, but around 10:1
turns ratio may be a good place to start.

If you only do read/print then there is no reason for the joystick stuff
not to take 90% of the time even if it is efficient.


The truth is that int 15H joystick reading IS slow. I read it directly
from the hardware port. Note that doing so exposes you to intermittent
disturbance from interrupts, so you may want to read (say) twice in a
row and keep the lower results. Don't just turn interrupts off, it may
prove detrimental to the health of any high speed comms and other
devices.

Here is an example of how to do this:

/* ------------------------------ joy.c ------------------------------------- */

/* An example of how to read PC joystick port by polling the hardware port
 * directly.
 * Uses inp()/outp() for byte port access.
 * Will timeout when 'int count=0' counts up to zero.
 * This sample reads one port (A is presented and B is in the comments).
 * You can read both at once by merging the two, but it will time out
 * when either joystick is not connected.
 *
 * There is no need to optimize this routine since it runs for as long as
 * the joystick circuitry needs.

Subject: Gaza and separation from Israel


Gaza and the idea of separation

The Israeli Left's inability to cope with the challenges it is
presented with by reality becomes obvious at those moments when
the reality does not line up with the expectations of the left. We
were able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of the
Palestinian's popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid -
currently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous
statement: ""You look for me !"", i.e., I'am not making any more
efforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid's point of view,
Palestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew
or the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the
Palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. Similarly
MERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism from
residents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his
government's and his party's lack of action for human rights and
peace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether
they would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists'
perspective this is the best government because it is THEIR
government, regardless of what it does.

These members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the
future of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want to
dictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential step
towards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin's
government, and from their point of view the expulsions were a
marginal byproduct of this ""government of peace"", which need not
disturb the routine course of events. Likewise the ""Rabinic""
policies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets
and the significant increases in the number of persons injured in
the suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.

But the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces
itself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has
lost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian
workers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel
Aviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing
to propose except separation: Let's cut ourselves off from the
Palestinians, let's build a fence so high that they won't be able
to harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a
fence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.

Meron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha'aretz (4-3-93): ""...The
liberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical
separation and 'the future of the territories', must come to
understand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arab
workers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement
designed for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that
their ideological support for separation only provides
'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the <status
quo>.

Enforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the
ruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears
its burden. [.....].

""Whoover thinks that 'out of Gaza first' is a liberal,
humanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether
this position is also moral. It is very easy to shake off
responsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to
thus also disregard responsibility for it's creation. It is very
easy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in
Jerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at
the disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue
all their interests, but is barred to the Arabs..."".",17

lock in on one and average the others out.

  Actually, an accelerator such as the Daystar 33 MHz 68040 is cheaper than
upgrading to a Q700 (25 MHz).  The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas
the upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700
upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21""
with 8 bit depth and up to 16"" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It
also has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which
makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.

  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you're
better off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an

To incrementally update the contents of windows, I use the following trick:

	1. Set the window background to None,
	2. Call XClearArea(display, window, 0, 0, 0, 0, True),
	3. Restore the window background to its correct value.

The call to XClearArea does not repaint the window background, but still
generates exposure events for visible parts of the window.

In order to let my application know that these expose events must be handled
incrementally (something is already displayed on the screen and may need to
be erased), I encapsulate the 3 operations with 2 self addressed client
messages, which preserve asynchronicity between the client and the server.

       the line and 7,4 MHz when loading a 256 pixels image. This
       provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal
       and vertical directions.
       The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256.
       Video signal capture time - 2.5s.

                     CONTROLLER VS52

       The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM
       PC AT or any other machine of that type. The controller was
       created on the base of modern elements, including user
       programmable gate arrays.
       The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different
       resolutions. Its flexible architecture makes possible to change
       technical parameters. Instead of TV signal one can process any
       other analog signal (including signals from slow-speed scanning
       devices).
       The controller has the following technical characteristics:
       - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ;
       - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64
       to 1024x512 pixels ;
       - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024
       pixels;
       - video signal capture time - 40 ms.
       - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024
       pixels ;
       - number of gray level - 256 ;
       - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ;
       - 4 input video multiplexer ;
       - input/output lookup table (LUT);
       - possibility to realize ""scroll"" and ""zoom"";













       - 8 lines for external synchronization (an input using external
       controlling signal) ;
       - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog -
       digital converter;
       - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor.
       One can change all listed above functions and parameters of the
       controller by reprogramming it.

"How long can the Leafs play short-handed and still be expected to
score?  They did some fine penely-killing in the first (2 men down
for a couple of minutes at one point) but they just couldn't keep it 
up.  They spent virtually the entire game either short-handed or
just coming off a penelty -- as soon as they'd get re-grouped, they're
penalized again!
 
Sheesh -- like Gilmour said after the 1st -- you can't go calling 
every little push an shove in a game like that.  And if you're going
to, you have to do it for both teams.
 
Pearson (one of my four favorite Leafs) played like a bonehead -- I
saw him personally screw up at least 2 good scoring opportunities, and
then he got that *bonehead* 5-minute major high-sticking penalty.
 
Cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a hand-full of
games ago and he played a good game.  If the other players on his line
can smarten up, that line should do okay.  Clark's got to get tough --
he's got to intimidate and go for the net.  Send Clark up the left 
wing over the blue line a couple times... his patented wrist shot will
put some numbers on the board... and Pearson... heck, maybe he should
be benched.
 
I hate to repeat Grapes, but where the heck was Foligno?  Zezel can't
do all the checking himself -- and get MacLlwain on the move... we 
need some speed out there!  Keep Potvin in net, he did okay 
considering... although (like I said a couple weeks ago) Potvin 
messed up in a couple games in the AHL playoffs last year -- he can 
easily do it again.
 
My prediction last week was Toronto in 7 -- that the games DET wins 
will be blow-outs and the game TOR wins will be close -- I still stand
by that.
 
Don't fret, Leafs fans, in order to win in 7, the other team has to
win 3! :-)
 
Burns is going to make some magic -- he'll mix up some lines.  Match
the Wings line-per-line.  He'll have his team checking hard, and he'll
never let them get out-numbered in their own end.  The Leafs will win
Wednesday night... and will take 1 or their home games (probably the

Ah, double-fulfillment.  First of all I would say that I'm not sure all
the prophecies had double-fulfillment, e.g., the Isaiah 7:14 prophecy.

I would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not mean
it will occur always, especially with regard to NT prophecies. The apostles
who quoted the OT and applied those passages to Jesus were acting as divine
messengers and giving the inerrant Word of God to the Church.  No one has
that authority today.  No one has the apostolic authority to say that
such-and-such a prophecy has double-fulfillment.  If the imagry of
Revelation fits with events of the 1st century, it is folly for us to try

That's why zoologists refer to you as a 'fecal shield'. Colonel Semen 
M. Budienny, a subsequent Soviet military fame, said about the 
Armenian genocide of 2.5 million defenseless Turkish and Kurdish 
women, children and elderly people during his visit to Anatolia 
in June 1919 that

""the Armenians had become troublemakers, their Hinchakist
 and Dashnakist parties were opportunist, serving as lackeys
 of whatever power happened to be ascendent.""

In September 16, 1920, Major General W. Thwaites, Director of
Military Intelligence, wrote to Lord Hardinge, Under-Secretary
of State for Foreign Affairs:

""...it is useless to pretend that the Armenians are satisfactory
 allies, or deserving of all the sympathy to which they claim.""[1]

[1] F.O. 331/3411/158288.

In the Special Collection at Stanford Hoover Library, donated by
Georgia Cutler, the letter dated Nov. 1, 1943 states that

""Prescot Hall wrote a large volume to prove that Armenians were
 not and never could be desirable citizens, that they would 
 always be unscrupulous merchants.""

"For those missing the context of this thrilling discussion between
Jim and I, Jim wrote the following to me in e-mail after I pointed out
that he (Jim) had taken a quote out of context:

He directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy, again based on a lack of
response to an article by Robert Weiss, toward Stephen.

I pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss and
Jim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult to
understand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't
have time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote
out of context.  

I asked Jim the following:

Jim replied by saying 

But today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject
""Silence is concurrence"":  


Which is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of
context isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on
t.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.

Does ""silence is concurrence"" imply that Jim thinks that because I
didn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes
out of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this
question; read what he has written and decide for yourself.


But back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next 
gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he
concluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide
the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion.
Today we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help
make it more clear, Jim), titled ""Inductive Logic"":


More red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large
number of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I ""axed"" his articles,
but not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ...
Well, I can't see where he is going with this.

But I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80
articles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions with
Frank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position that
they are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Meritt
where I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man
argument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.)

through your induction engine and see what pops out.  ",19
"As our local.religion.christian BBS group seems moribund, I'm posting here.

On one of the Sundays just before Easter I went to church.  The sermon was
based on a story in the Book of Joshua.  (The one about Joshua sending out
spies to the land he was planning to take)  What I particularly remember,
because of having heard part of a CBC radio documentary on Bosnia, was that
the Rahab (the woman who sheltered the spies) said that the people were
""melting in fear.""  What with having heard that CBC radio documentary and
knowing that the Muslims in Bosnia were losing the war, I felt
uncomfortable.  After all, the Serbs are driving non-Christians out.  On
the other hand, ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the values
held by our secular society.  Anyhow members of that church are involved in
out-of-country missionary work.  Also, the pastor has talked of spiritual
warfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area.

The next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelites
take Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except
for Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports about
Bosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that
the massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered
me was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I
shouldn't be so troubled about the reports of ""ethnic cleansing"" in
Bosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims.
Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians
who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing
God's work?",15

Gifts of the Spirit should not be seen as an endorsement of ones behavior.
A lot of people have suffered because of similar beliefs.  Jesus said
that people would come to Him saying ""Lord, Lord,"" and proclaiming
the miraculous works they had done in His name.  Jesus would tell
them that they were workers of iniquity that do not know Him, and to
depart from Him.  

That is not to say that this will happen to everyone who commits a homosexual
sin.  If the Holy Spirit were only given to the morally perfect, He would
not be given to me, or any of us.  God can forgive any sin, if we repent.
But people should be careful not to think, ""God has given me a gift of
the Spirit, it must be okay to be gay.""  That is dangerous (see also hebrews
6 about those who have partaken of the Holy Spirit and of the powers of 
the world to come.)


Jesus doesn't ask us to change our own nature.  We cannot lift ourselves
out of our own sin- but we must submit to His hand as He changes our
nature.  Practicing homosexual acts and homosexual lusts violates the
morality that God has set forth.  

If you don't believe that, and think those of us who do are just ignorant,

	  DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA ?!

   I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed
   to Islamic movements and the PLO; it simply can't be proven as part of their
   plan !

   (Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity
   since it was coined by Bnai Brith)

   What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media,
   is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic
   Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in
   Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.

   However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their
   homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political
   thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the
   Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.

   As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.

   Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true
   super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the
   Jews used to establish their state : Religion.


   Ahmed.

Forget the syntax, Ahmed, and focus on the semnatics. The fact is that
the PLO does not recognize Israel's right to exist. This is perfectly
obvious from the PLO covenant (Cairo, 1968). The covenant calls for
the destruction of the ""Zionist entity"". As far as I know the
Israel-destruction clauses still exist in the document which specifies
the purpose for the existence of the PLO. If you would like, I can
post the relevant caluses.

Now the Hamas ideal is far more radical, it seems. I know it has been
posted here several times, and while I do not have a copy of it, I am
sure that someone does and he (or she, of course) would be more than
happy to repost it.

Regardless of phrasing, groups like Hamas, and the Hezbollah, and
even the newly moderate and politically-correct PLO, have at the very
heart of their ideologies the need for the destrcution of Israel.

It just seems to me that Mr. Davidsson's suggestion that Jews support
people envolved in these organizations is not a particularly appealing
one to many Jews.",17

"[An article from comp.org.eff.news, EFFector Online 5.06 - Carl]

                       April 16, 1993

      INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY  
                           PROPOSAL

       The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement 
on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of 
millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a 
comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues 
such as export controls which have effectively denied most people 
easy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues 
posed by new technology.

       However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has 
already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before 
any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the 
Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone 
equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed 
by the National Security Agency. The so-called ""Clipper Chip"" is an 
80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into 
chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow 
agents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over 
law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The 
encryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be 
available to any manufacturer for incorporation into their 
communications products.

       This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .

       First, the Administration appears to be adopting a solution 
before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper chip may 
not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may 
have better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the 
government as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips.  Rather,
independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets 
based on open standards.

       Second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested. 
Yet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm 
classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public 
and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a 
standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.  

       Third, while the use of the split-key, dual-escrowed 
system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and 
law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored 
publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the 
safety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive 
individual's fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal 
inquiries?  

       In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the 
importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into 
digital privacy and security.  However, the ""Clipper chip"" solution 
ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, not be adopted before 
the discussion even begins.

DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:

ESCROW

The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of 
whom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid 
warrant, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts 
over to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General 
will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the 
Administration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal 
agency, perhaps the Federal Reserve, and one non-governmental 
organization.  But, there is no agreement on the identity of the agents 
yet.

Key registration would be done by the manufacturer of the 
communications device.  A key is tied to the device, not to the person 
using it.

CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS

The Administration claims that there are no back door means by 
which the government or others could break the code without 
securing keys from the escrow agents and that the President will 
be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order 
to prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for 
an all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security 
arrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results 
of the investigation would then be made public.

GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER

In order to get a market moving, and to show that the government 
believes in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big 
customers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, 
VP Al Gore, and maybe even the President.

Sorry, I misread your remark about young men and women.  (Though I am now
unsure what that sentence does mean.)


You implied that anyone who wants to send troops to Bosnia wants to do so to
help the ""butchers of their choice"".  Since the primary targets of help are
Muslim victims of ""ethnic cleansing"", you imply that such Muslim victims are
butchers.


This implies both sides are equal.  True, it may sometimes be difficult or
impossible to determine which side is the victim, but that does not mean that
victims do not exist.  Would you, in WWII have said that there were atrocities
on the sides of both the Jews and the Germans?


Yes, but both sides want different things.  The Muslims chiefly want to not
be ""ethnic cleansed"".  The Serbians want to ""ethnic cleanse"" the Muslims.  It
is indeed true that each side will stop when it gets what it wants, but the
things that the two sides want are not equivalent.


I recall, before we did anything for Somalia, (apparent) left-wingers saying
that the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than to
Somalia was because the Somalis are third-worlders who Americans consider
unworthy of help.  They suddenly shut up when the US decided to send troops to
the opposite place than that predicted by the theory.

For that matter, this theory of yours suggests that Americans should want to
help the Serbs.  After all, they're Christian, and the Muslims are not.  If
the desire to intervene in Bosnia is based on racism against people that are
less like us, why does everyone _want_ to help the side that _is_ less like us?
Especially if both of the sides are equal as you seem to think?

"""Space Station Redesign Leader Says Cost Goal May Be
Impossible""

Today (4/6) the Washington Post ran an article with the
headline shown above. The article starts with ""A leader
of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned
space station said yesterday the job is tough and may
be impossible."" O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is
possible to cut costs that much and still provide for
meaningful research ""is a real question for me.""
O'Connor said ""everything is fair game,"" including
""dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the
aerospace industry, chopping management of the space
station program at some NASA facilities around the
country, working closely with the Russian space station
Mir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the
manned space shuttle fleet.""

O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options
so far, and they are sorting the serious candidates
into three categories based on cost.

The Post says O'Connor described the design derived
from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe
Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I
listened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the press
on Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connor
talked about how the White House wants three options,
sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part
of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has
formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC,
modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch
Core [""wingless Orbiter""] @ JSC. Later, in response to
a reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor say
the option based on a SSF redesign was a ""moderate""
cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not
the ""high cost"" option as Sawyer wrote).

The article goes on to describe the other two options
as ""one features modules that could gradually be fitted
together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The
other is a core facility that could be deposited in
orbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option
would use existing hardware from the space shuttle -
the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure.""",14

"My old jacket is about to bite the dust so I'm in the market for a new riding
jacket.  I'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I would
like to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford $700 for it right now.

I'm considering two basic options:

1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs
    due to recent price increases, but I'd imagine over $400.
    That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact
    that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates
    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.

2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new 
    Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey
    unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather
    are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose
    value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper
    than upper Aerostich.

Requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other 
layers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out 
lining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, 
shoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a 
reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would 
be a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below
freezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.

Please fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...

Who said ISA was necessary?  EISA or VLB are the only interfaces worth

You didn't read to carefully.  VLB-IDE uses the same connection mechanism

interfaced to ISA, EISA or VLB matters not.

On mine, for one thing.  SCSI blows IDE out of the water, hands down.  If
IDE has better throughput, why isn't it used on workstations and file
servers?

: at least 5, maybe 10 megs/sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence?
: What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost?

No, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives
at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.

I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I
haven't seen IDE drives cheaper.

: The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card

: or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions
: of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to

No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because
nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read:
easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or
Mac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.

: data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better
: (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when
: managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.

On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for
expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The
following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:

A (partial?) list:
	1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them 
	concurrently.
	2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac
	and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice
	with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)
	3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For
	instance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor
	212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will
	work no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the
	termination, plug it in, and away it goes.
	4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that
	the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is
	quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:
	to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very
	noticable, as many things can be going on at once.

One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the
ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with
little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've
added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to
have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive
all on the same card.  

Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.  No mysterious jumpers to figure out.

"ACLU Official Policies.

Policy 18, for example, opposes rating systems for motion
pictures: ""Industry sponsored ratings systems create the
potential for constraining the creative process and thus
contracting the marketplace of ideas. Despite the stated goal of
providing guidance to parents, experience has shown that ratings
inevitably have serious chilling effects on freedom of
expression.""

In regards to the Pledge of Allegiance, the ACLU states in its
Policy 84: ""The insertion of the words `under God' into the
Pledge of Allegiance is a violation of the constitutional
principle of separation of Church and State.""

Policy 120 states that, ""Military conscription under any
circumstances is a violation of civil liberties and

during wartime because of the ""anti-democratic power it gives
government to wage war without support of the people.""

Policy 125 states, ""The ACLU calls for a broad-based inquiry into
war crimes within the widest possible definition of war crimes
against humanity, and crimes against the peace, focusing upon the
actions of the United States military and other combatants

Vietnam.""

Policy 133 states, ""The ACLU recognizes that US government
reliance upon nuclear weaponry as a dominant element of foreign

reintegrating the offender into the community, and the goals of
reintegration are furthered much more readily by working with the

[By the way Mr DeCenso, you really should have looked in the index of your
Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich Greek lexicon.  You would have found that the word in
Acts for ""lot"" is ""kleros,"" not ""CHORION"" as stated by Mr Archer, and nowhere
in the very large discussion of kleros in done the to ""Theological Dictionary
of the New Testament"" by Bromley, is the meaning ""burial plot"" discussed.  It
discusses the forms of ""kleros"" (eg: kleros, kleroo, etc), and the various
meanings of ""kleros"" (eg: ""plot of land,"" and ""inheritance""), but mentions
nothing about CHORION or ""burial plot."" (Why does this not surprise me?) Thus
it would seem to be a very good thing you dumped Archer as a reference.]

I owe the group an apology.  It is my habit to check my articles before and
after their submission for errors.  In my last article I stated:
 
 
I was wrong. I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar, and thus
confused ""kleros"", the second to last word in Acts 1:17 as being the plot of
land discussed.  In actuality it is ""chorion"", which is the last word Acts
1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss ""chorion"" so I
cannot report as to the nuances of the word.
 
I don't know if someone else would have caught this, though I am sure that
someone would be able to do so, but I have an aversion to disseminating
mistakes, especially when someone else might use that mistake to prove a point""

Good point.  But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you
have produced only superficial reasonings and observations. Nor have you dug
deeper.  I'm glad you have begun in this post.  I will begin Greek studies on
these passages in more depth than I thought necessary, as well.

evidence.  Now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated it
often enough:
 
 
But are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole.  Let's
see, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other
passages, we see that he has also used (b).  On the other hand he has
presented no use of:
 
(d) historical context                or
(e) historical content                or

MY REPLY...
Question:  Do you find such criteria important?  If so, do you plan on starting
to use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present
shallow observations (I don't mean this in a bad way).
At this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a
total exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating
around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believe
it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re:
Judas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use
several of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also.
It will greatly enhance our study of these passages.

""The only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other

MY REPLY...
The reason is simple...you are mistating the passages.  You claim that the
PASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one
another.
(1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention;
(2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas' death, as you claim.  But we'll look
at your defense of this later.
 
Also, the ""reward of iniquity"" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of
silver in Matthew's PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at
stating why you believe it is).
 
At this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural
groundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.
 
DB...
""Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage
as he has done with Judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so
that both could be considered correct.""
 
MY REPLY...
One of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is
that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these
passages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's
explanation of Judas' death...

HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING
HIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND ""FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN""
=============================================================
 
This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are
constantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent
discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.
Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is
destroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at
all.
Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and
was crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do
they necessarily contradict each other?
Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that
Judas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling
something black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be
true and supplementary.
A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the
edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there
for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas
fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.
The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this
explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the
valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see
rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.
There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.
Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on
this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are
not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced
was the decomposition of his body before his fall.
Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.
This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a
pistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at
the same time.
On the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting
himself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping
form the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the
case of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a
situation of different perspectives of the same event.

""At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:
 
 
Actually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer
it because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out
that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a
bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy
movies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.""
 
MY REPLY...
I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a
call re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother
is on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a
local hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.
 
To assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is
""begging the question"", if I may quote you.

""This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other
qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.""
 
MY REPLY...
Qualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention
below.
Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we
have re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's
synonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But
he lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can
discover.

So it's OK to use Christian sources to back your points?  What about Tony's
position.  Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility?
 
Also, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or
deceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done
with Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including
their ""interpretation"" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find
some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.
 
You also noted they ""interpreted"" the hanging as meaning he died.  Although
that is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?  Remember,
that's the first criteria we must examine.

""In each case, these references specifically describe that the interpretation

MY REPLY...
[^^^ above, mine]
No you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly
probable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result.
 
The Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New
Testament.
 
In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),
it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : ""Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was
not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his
city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he
was buried in his father's tomb.""             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel ""hanged himself"" [Gr. Sept.,
APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, ""and died"".  Here we have no doubt of the
result.
In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.
 
Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply
means ""hang oneself"".

As I said in an earlier post...
 
_____________________________________________________________________
Although I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable
explanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria),
I've recently noticed some new things in Matthew.
 
MAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,
and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and
said, ""It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the
price of blood."" And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's
field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of
Blood to this day.
 
First of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of
hanging. All it says is that he ""went and hanged himself."" Luke however, in
Acts, tells us that ""and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all
his entrails gushed out."" This is a pretty clear indication (along with the
other details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle,
etc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that
                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Matthew and Luke both recount Judas' death is highly probable, but not clear

Here we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed.
Let's look at the passage in Matthew:
 
MAT 27:4 saying, ""I have sinned by betraying innocent blood."" And they said,
""What is that to us? You see to it!""
 
MAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,
and went and hanged himself.
 
MAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, ""It is not
lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.""
 
MAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field,
to bury strangers in.
 
MAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
 
Notice verse 5...""Then he...went and hanged himself.""
Matthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as a
result of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
What does Acts say?
ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and
falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.
 
ACT 1:20 ""For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be
desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'
 
Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas' death....So, my line of
reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the ""two"" accounts of Judas'
death is this...Matthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died; he does
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
say Judas ""hanged himself"", but he didn't specifically say Judas died in the
hanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
However, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is no
contradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas' `death'.
 
.......
 
MY REPLY...
...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records
his death.  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging
and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be
the case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a
                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
result of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he probably did, but...?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
______________________________________________________________________
 
I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations, but
in looking at the texts initially, we can't assume Judas died.  It is, however,
highly probable.                            ^^^^^^
 
DB...
""By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had
different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One
simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version as
the correct version in both Matt and Acts.  ""The Biblical Knowledge Commentary""
suggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly
exploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope
broke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain
how a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).""
 
MY REPLY...
The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person
was suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may
have deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell
upon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a
superficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not
given a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted
post gave us some...

Now truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the
source of the Potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is
correct: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist
who claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to
thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the
prophesy of the Potter's field came from).""
 
MY REPLY...
Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss
this with you.

As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the
money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather
than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically
mention ""the reward of iniquity"" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions
what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 ""...concerning
Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus."").  Now I would point out
that when the Bible describes an act of ""iniquity,"" and then immediately
discusses ""*the* reward of iniquity,"" it would be rather inane to suggest that
it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.""
 
MY REPLY...
Dave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!
 
ACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples
(altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,
ACT 1:16 ""Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy
Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide
to those who arrested Jesus;
ACT 1:17 ""for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.""
ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and
falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.
ACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field
is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)
ACT 1:20 ""For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be
desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'
 
Notice that in verse 16, the word ""iniquity"" is not used.  Rather, it states
that Judas ""became a guide to those who arrested Jesus"".
But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, ""for he was numbered with us and
obtained a part in this ministry.""  What part did Judas play in their ministry?
         ^^^^^^
JOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a
thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.
JOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had
said to him, ""Buy those things we need for the feast,"" or that he should give
something to the poor.
 
So, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se.
Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer,
according to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of ""wages of
iniquity"" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen
by Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical
explanation of what the ""wages of iniquity"" are.  What do you think, Dave?

[Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect
that's because our primary source of information is prophets and
visionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However
both Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation
to John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and
eternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that
imply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of
similar passages where Jesus says things like ""even XXX will be better
off than you in the judgement.""  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who
gets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these
passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens,
so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or
hell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only
Christian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the
Mormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far
enough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their
ideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition
to the Bible and ""Holy Tradition"" of a more generic Christian sort.

Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of
associating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free
us from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass.  If you
like test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale,
but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that
was prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading.
Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to
see why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are
differences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all
agree that in one way or another, God cheats.

I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly
how far God's cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don't
explicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their
hearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in
principle, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear
description of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he
provided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing
line.  Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether
other individuals are saved or not.",15

Acronym List for sci.astro, sci.space, and sci.space.shuttle:

favorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there's an acronym *not*
on this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure

Note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen*

The list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  All
comments regarding it are welcome; I'm reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.

Note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you're on your
own for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of
acronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that
are essentially always explained as they're introduced are omitted.
Further, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of
the list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they're simply
different ways of referring to the same thing.

Thanks to everybody who's sent suggestions since the first version of

Special thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA

If you force me to do something, am I morally responsible for it?


Well, make up your mind.    Is it to be ""instinctive not to murder""
or not?


It's not even correct.    Animals of the same species do kill
one another.


Sigh.   I wonder how many times we have been round this loop.

I think that instinctive bahaviour has no moral significance.
I am quite prepared to believe that higher animals, such as
primates, have the beginnings of a moral sense, since they seem
to exhibit self-awareness.


So what?     Are you trying to say that some killing in animals
has a moral significance and some does not?   Is this your

That means that it is an effective anti-recidivism measure.  It does
not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime
in the first place.

The true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually
stop one from murdering.  (Or commiting treason -- are there any other
capital crimes anywhere in the USA?)  That is, if there were no death
penalty, would its introduction deter a would-be criminal from
committing her/his crime?  I doubt it.

This is only the first step.  Even if it were a strong deterrent
(short of being a complete deterrent) I would reject it.  For what
about the case of the innocent executed?

And even if we could eliminate this possibility, I would reject the
death penalty as immoral. This makes me something of a radical on
the issue, although I think there are many opponents of captial
punishment who agree with me, but who find the innocent executed the
strongest argument to make.

I would, if magically placed in charge, facilitate state-aided suicide
for criminals who have life-sentences.  This could be a replacement
for capital punishment.  Those who don't want to live the rest of
their lives in jail would always have this option.",0

Very well put.  And, in the case of someone who calls himself a Christian
brother yet continues in his sin (and claims that his sin is not a sin at 
all, but perfectly acceptable), what should be done?  Should Christians 
just ignore a sinful lifestyle in order to not offend the person?  By 
reaffirming that the lifestyle is sinful according to the Bible, are 
they using ""a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus""? 

Frankly, I find the occurance of a homosexual Christian attempting to 
pass himself off as a 'straight' Christian in order to have other 
Christians accept his chastisement better a *lot* more serious than 
people reaffirming that the Bible teaches homosexuality is a sin.  ",19
"Hi!

   I'm looking into buying a serial port switcher, because while my Mac has
two serial ports, I have AppleTalk, a modem, a printer, MIDI, and a sound
digitizer.  (2 != 5, unfortunately.)

   Specifically, I'm looking at the Axion electronic switcher, because it
seems to be fairly cheap.  (About $128 at MacZone.)

   Does anyone know anything about it?  I've heard that with most of these
things you can still only use 2 serial ports at a time, it just prevents you
from physically swapping cables.  Although I've also heard that programs
that use the Comm Toolbox may be able to use as many serial ports as they
want; does anyone know if this is true with the Axion switchbox?

   Finally, if the Axion stinks, or if you're using something else that you
think is good, I'd be interested in hearing about other products.  I would
like to spend under $140, if possible.

Come on!  Most if not all Arabs are sympathetic to the Palestinian war 
against Israel.  That is why the ADL monitors Arab organizations.  That is
the same reason the US monitored communist organizations and Soviet nationals
only a few years ago.  


All of these groups have, in the past, associated with or been a part of anti-
Israel activity or propoganda.  The ADL is simply monitoring them so that if
anything comes up, they won't be caught by surprise.



No, that is why World Trade Center bombings don't happen in Israel (aside from
the fact that there is no world trade center) and why people like Zein Isa (
Palestinian whose American group planned to bow up the Israeli Embassy and 
""kill many Jews."") are caught.  As Mordechai Levy of the JDL said, Paranoid

"I heard that Eli is selling the team to a group in Cinninati. This would

up faster in the O's hierarchy of the minors faster than expected. Mike
Flanagan is trying for another comeback. Big Ben is being defended by
coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot, most came
in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half. This
may be Ben's year. 
	I feel that while this may not be Mussina's Cy Young year, he will
be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year
around August. I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the O's need.

better and play like he did in '91. The O's right now don't have many
left-handed hitters. Anderson proving last year was no fluke and Cal's return
to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant. The

   My understanding is that the 'expected errors' are basically
   known bugs in the warning system software - things are checked
   that don't have the right values in yet because they aren't
   set till after launch, and suchlike. Rather than fix the code
   and possibly introduce new bugs, they just tell the crew
   'ok, if you see a warning no. 213 before liftoff, ignore it'.

"Jeff,
  I have answers to both of your questions.  First, I recommend the Sony
CPD-1320 monitor.  It is a 14"" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designed
specifically for use with the LC.  It works only with Macs with specific video
capabilities which means only the LC's and anything after the ci.  All it
takes is a MAC<->VGA cable (I recommend one from James Engineering which is
about $20).  These cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of
comparable monitors because they are not multisynch.  I have used one for half

why there were delays and they had Supra's number ready for me.  The only

Geez, Dal must have slipped something into Ted's drink sometime.  Comparing
Prince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable.  Prince has never hit well in
the minors and he's now 27 years old, I think.  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter
in the minors.  (I'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don't have
another brain cramp and forget.)  He had a very good year at Louisville 
before coming up to the majors.  As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up
in the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  When he got to the 
majors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he 
became Exhibit 312 in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation 
as an outstanding defensive catcher.  It's not clear he ever learned to
hit.  His four years with more than 100 AB--

Born 31 July 1962
Year     AB      BA     SLG     OBA  
1988    195    .282    .320    .328
1990    220    .277    .373    .321
1991    459    .264    .351    .317
1992    485    .249    .359    .290 

No power, less-than-league-average walks, peak year when he turned 28, 
now declining.  If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince,
given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors, it's not
a rosy picture.

BTW, I'm still unhappy with moving Zeile, who had the same reputation 
coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi, except that he was
a much, much better hitter, to 3rd where he could be an average hitter
and a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter
as an average (or below average) fielding catcher.

henrik]  Country. Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the
henrik]  KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan. 

BM] Gimme a break.  CAPITAL letters, or NOT, the above is pure nonsense.  It
BM] seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities
			^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
henrik]	Again, Armenians in KARABAKH are SIMPLY defending themselves. What do
henrik]	want them to do. Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them.

News reports I've seen say otherwise both location and motives wise.  
CAPS don't change facts.

BM] while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment,
BM] will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it
BM] is a part of it.  

henrik]   Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged 
henrik]   training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.

So?  Should I, at this point break into caps and start talking about 
DEFENSE etc.?  I don't know how 'fully engaged' Turkey is/was though.

henrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 
henrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the 
henrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending 
henrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION. 

BM] Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them
BM]  within their borders?  

henrik] Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into 
henrik] the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.

So I hear.  This justifies bloodshed N years after the fact?

henrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the 
henrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER 
henrik] OCCUR again.

BM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?

henrik] It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped
henrik] into Armenia if SHE could.

Why would Turkey do that?  Do you not realize that this is a local clash
that Turkey never wished to see happen?  Turkey has other plans for region,
like economic revival, co-operation etc.  Good stuff in other words,  I'd
be happy to bicker with Armenians over trade barriers and such on USENET
rather than 'who killed whom in what way' which I detest doing and wouldn't 
do.  

BM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header
BM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  

henrik]	   Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many
henrik]	   cases, HISTORY repeats itself. 

Even if one buys into your implicit premise, the sane thing to do would
be to try not to provoke Turkey as was done in '74.  If there'd been
a democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in Athens at the
time, everybody would have stayed home with their families.  [I have no
wish to go into the Cyprus quarrel, but I suspect what I've said is not
only accurate but also palatable to all parties involved]

BM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes 
BM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring
BM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians 
BM] are attacking Azeri towns.

henrik]	   So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey
henrik]	   wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!

So what do you think we want?  War, death and destruction?  

henrik]	   I will believe it when I see it.

No, if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it.

henrik]  Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing
henrik]to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?
	
This kind of childish rhetoric doesn't help anthing.

henrik]  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the
henrik]  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean
henrik]  BURNING people ALIVE !

Now, some Azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff
perpetrated by Armenians.  One should re-hash stuff like this often to
keep the hatred alive, right?

BM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the 
BM]futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that 
BM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's 
BM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.  

henrik]	   Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are 
henrik]	   NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY 
henrik]	   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN. 

Well they obviously aren't getting anywhere with their current methods
of asking (not very peaceful I'd say).

BM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent 
BM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe 
BM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better 
BM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?

henrik]	   Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the
henrik]	   conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in
henrik]	   KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.

I don't know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans.
Peace isn't what's happening right now, furthermore what's happening
right now isn't condusive to peace.  You can spend days and nights 
raving about how 'right' the Armenian position is and I'm sure
there'll be others who'd be happy to talk to you by arguing the other
side.  If entrenched positions lead to war, and if people want peace
than they should sit down and talk about a compromise.  Armenia isn't
strong enough to exercise the 'we think we're right, and we have the 
bombs, so we'll do whatever we want, so there...' style of foreign 
relations.  Yes you can type Stalin in caps, and give one sided
atrocity stories etc. but for peace you need to be willing to talk to 
the other side.  You personally can choose not to do that of course,
this being just USENET.  The people in power shouldn't be so childish.


BM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes
BM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of 
BM] their blood and future. 

henrik]	   Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension
henrik]	   to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH
henrik]	   are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.

Azeri's would disagree with you on this, and the maps I've seen support
what they'd be saying.  It doesn't seem likely that a solution will be
reached in this manner.  

BM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize 
BM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians
BM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate 
BM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in
BM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for
BM] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading
BM] inflammatory half-truths.

henrik]   It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative. I am absolutely
henrik]   for it. 

It didn't look it when I read your posting.  It would seem to me 
that if you can spew mis-information about a boogey-man, you can also
talk about how one might avoid the nastiness.  Fair?

henrik] But, in the meantime, if you do not take care of yourself,
henrik] you will be WIPED out. Such as the case in the era of 1915-20 of
henrik] The Armenian Massacres.

You don't realize I can say the same thing about 'The Turkish Massacres.'
Yes, boys and girls, let's always talk about how bad and nasty things were.
Let's do that so we're overwhelmed by anger, and let's do that so our
kids will also be hateful.  Sounds crazy doesn't it?  Don't do it then.",17

I was having major memory problems a few monthes ago.
getting parity error - system halted error message in windows.
I ran QA/PLUS, Check It, Diagnose, as well as several shareware

these store bought/ shareware memory diagnostics either ran fine
without errors or found an error at some address that I couldn't

the (now deleted) steps to find bad memory chips. I found 2

        anyway I did filter out all the bad memory chips using 
combinations of 4 of the 8 meg chips and creating a RAM drive to
test on. Although it dodn't alleviate my parity error problems
in windows. I did manage to find bad memory chips in this manner
It has NEVER failed to find a bad chip for me. and the commercial/

pointing to an addreww which I have no idea on what chip it is.

This isn't anything new.  Back in 1985 I was driving under a high
overpass at night on I-805 in San Diego when I caught a glimpse of
someone on the overpass.  As I passed under a rock slammed against the
metal between the winshield and right front window.  My girlfriend was
in the seat next to it.  I called the police from the next exit, but I
doubt if they were found.

About five years ago in San Diego someone was put into a coma from a
brick being thrown through his sunroof as he was driving and
subsequently crashed.  I don't think he ever came out of the coma, and I
haven't heard anything about it for a couple years.


Probably because there are many children there.  Also the minor fact
that other than defending themselves from 100 some people attacking them
they haven't threatened or attacked anyone outside the compound in
years.  Being a promiscuous religious nut does not constitute grounds
for a mass murder of Koresh and his followers.

"Ten Questions about arab countries
----------------------------------

I would be thankful if any of you who live in arab countries could
help to provide accurate answers to the following specific questions.
These are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and
again by people around me.

1.      Is it true that many arab countries don't recognize
Israeli nationality ?  That people with Israeli stamps on their
passports can't enter arabic countries?

2.      Is it true that arabic countries such as Jordan and Syria
have undefined borders and that arab governments from 1948 until today
have refused to state where the ultimate borders of their states
should be?

3.      Is it true that arab countires refused to sign the Chemical
weapon convention treaty in Paris in 1993?

4.      Is it true that in arab prisons there are a number of
individuals which were tried in secret and for which their
identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are
state secrets ?

4a.	Is it true that some arab countries, like Syria, harbor Nazi
war criminals, and refuse to extradite them?

4b.	Is it true that some arab countries, like Saudi Arabia,
prohibit women from driving cars?

5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the Muslim
countries are subject to different laws than Muslims?

6.      Is it true that arab countries confiscated the property of
entire Jewish communites forced to flee by anti-Jewish riots?

7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed
a chemical weapons treaty that no arab nation was willing to sign?

8.      Is it true that Syrian Jews are required to leave a $10,000
deposit before leaving the country, and are no longer allowed to
emmigrate, despite promises made by Hafez Assad to George Bush?

9.	 Is it true that Jews in Muslim lands are required to pay a
special tax, for being Jews?

10.     Is it true that Intercontinental Hotel in Jerusalem was built
on a Jewish cemetary, with roads being paved over grave sites, and
gravestones being used in Jordanian latrines?

11.	Is it really cheesy and inappropriate to post lists of biased
leading questions?

11a.	Is it less appropriate if information implied in Mr.
Davidsson's questions is highly misleading?

"Replying to A.J. Teel:

	Well, the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that the
	Income Tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures for
	stopping withholding, et cetera have been out there for a
	while now.

Humbug.  Those letters don't provide ""concrete proof"" of anything at all
in the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu-
ally work for ordinary people in everyday situations.

Specifically, show us some case law in which the courts have ruled that
income tax is illegal and/or that ordinary working types do not have to
pay income tax (and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with-
out declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness).  This
issue is sufficiently important that I think we have a right to expect
something squarely on point from the US Supreme Court (in the case of
federal tax) or a state's supreme court (for a state's income tax).

Unless you can do that, I for one am unwilling to call your material
""concrete proof"".

	There has been no refutation to date.  Have the nay-sayers
	finally given up as defeated?  Sure would like to hear their
	reasons for disbelief at this point.

Refutation??  Refutation of what?  You haven't made a case yet.  You've
posted plenty of claims, but you haven't given us any valid reason to
believe that any court in the US will agree with you.  Your claims seem
on the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that I
feel the burden of proof is still on =you= to show that your arguments
have any merit whatsoever.  And the cases you've cited involve such
strange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings are
applicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appeal
to the Supreme Court.

Why can't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe, a regular
employee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to pay
his income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva-
sion, and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court
with a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally
voluntary?  What, you say?  No such case exists?  Hmmm, I wonder why
not; why haven't you?

	Shall I conclude that the point has been received and the
	opposition has forfeited the field?

With all due respect, you can conclude anything you want.  I just hope,
for your own sake, that you don't conclude that anyone in a position of
authority in the United States or any legitimate or illegitimate polit-
ical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions.

For that matter, I confess I'm thoroughly confused as to =why= you would
be looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since I thought you
told us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with big
banking interests since the 1938 ""admiralty jurisdiction"" coverup thing.
Do you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the trouble
to subvert the system, and yet would still promptly slink back into
their burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right
combination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo?

Not only that, but why do you even =care= what the US courts say anyway?
Didn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by US
officials to classify you as a ""14th Amendment federal citizen""?  When
the FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don't you just tell
them they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington,
D.C., where they belong?

Or maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which you
suggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like.
If you want to renounce society's legal framework, fine; we can just
declare you an outlaw, OK?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roads
with no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your wallet
can just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (with
plenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1-207).

Sorry, everyone, it's getting late, and I'm sick and tired of all this
garbage.  If I know what's good for me, I'll just clam up and stop try-
ing to refute this nonsense, and if anyone falls for it and winds up in
jail for tax evasion or what-not, it'll be on their own head.

Needless to say, none of the above represents the opinions of my current
employer -- who, in any case, is a Canadian and doesn't really need to
care too much about US tax law.  I, on the other hand, am a ""14th Amend-
ment federal citizen"", with a US passport to prove it, and plan to keep
on filing Form 1040's for the foreseeable future (though I will probably
not owe any US income tax due to the foreign earned income exclusion
and/or the foreign tax credit).

least 10 at bats.

It is early in the season so there are some very high numbers.  Last years
leader was Frank Thomas at 0.682.

Teams are denoted by an * as the first character of the name and each
player has his team preceeding his name.

The equations used are found at the end of the post.

I NEED to sell this pronto to get a car (my engine locked up)!
Machine runs great... only used in my house.  Has been covered when
not in use on the days I wasn't around.

$2,300 INCLUDING Federal Express Second Day Air, OR best offer, COD to
your doorstep (within continental US)!!  I need to sell this NOW, so
if you don't agree with the price, make an offer, but within reason.
;)

Thanks,

Suffering from a severe case of myopia? No Muslim left alive - not a 
single one. Leading the first Armenian units who crossed the Ottoman 
border in the company of the Russian invaders was the former Ottoman 
Parliamentary representative for Erzurum, Karekin Pastirmaciyan, who 
assumed the revolutionary name Armen Garo. Another former Ottoman 
parliamentarian, Hamparsum Boyaciyan, led the Armenian guerrilla forces 
who ravaged Turkish villages behind the lines under the nickname ""Murad"", 
especially ordering that 

         'Kill Turks and Kurds wherever you find them and in 
          whatever circumstances you find them. Turkish children 
          also should be killed as they form a danger to the 
          Armenian nation.' (Hamparsum Boyadjian - 1914)[1]

 [1] M. Varandian, ""History of the Dashnaktsutiun,"" p. 85.

Another former Member of Parliament, Papazyan, led the Armenian 
guerrilla forces that ravaged the areas of Van, Bitlis and Mush.

In March 1915, the Russian forces began to move toward Van. Immediately,
in April 11, 1915 the Armenians of Van began a revolt, massacring all 
the Turks in the vicinity so as to make possible its quick and easy 
conquest by Russians. Little wonder that Czar Nicholas II sent a 
telegram of thanks to the Armenian Revolutionary Committee of Van in 
April 21, 1915, ""thanking it for its services to Russia."" The Armenian 
newspaper Gochnak, published in the United States, also proudly 
reported in May 24, 1915 that 

""only 1,500 Turks remained in Van the rest having been slaughtered.""

""The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the
 area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population
 of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were
 Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.
 Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third
 of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the 
 Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan
 uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians
 as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,
 however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the
 guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000
 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character 
 notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian 
 Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the 
 southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia."" 
 (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of 
 Transcaucasia).

In 1920, '0' percent Turk. 

""We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
 of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. 
 Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts 
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
 completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They 
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
 into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole 
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
 Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for 
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
 scattered bones of the dead.""

 closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan 
 on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized 
 and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during 
 the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the
 southern side of the lake.""

""Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,
 Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.
 Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First
 World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
 to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other
 invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian
 success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of
 Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common
 soldiers began deserting in droves.""

""With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of
 World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy
 increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,
 Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn
 massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of
 expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.""

 plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans, with the 
 president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response:

  arms...Let the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the
  Bosporus. Let, with Your will, great Majesty, the peoples remaining
  under the Turkish yoke receive freedom. Let the Armenian people of Turkey
  who have suffered for the faith of Christ receive resurrection for a new

Are you people for real? The main legal principles of the Turkish State 
are summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:

	""The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State
	governed by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public
	peace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;
	loyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental
	tenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.""

Freedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing
the many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The
fact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be
attributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution.
The first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856.
Although the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force
only temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.

The 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and
the right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution
of 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing
the power of the Parliament and the government.

The First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the
occupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was
abolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the
occupying forces.

During the Independence War, the ""Turkish Grand National Assembly"" held their
first meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new
Turkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish
Republic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new
Constitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal 
backbone of today's modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a 
multi-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by
others in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been
based on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national
sovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.

""Major Principles of the Constitution""

The constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic
within the following principles:

- The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by 
  law;
- It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,
  human rights and the objectives of Ataturk;
- The language of the State is Turkish;
- Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.
  Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation;
- Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This
  power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else;
- Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers;
- Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the
  Turkish nation;
- All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,
  sex, or political beliefs;
- Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.

""Structure of the State""

In accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the
principle of ""division of power"" to create a balanced and self-controlled
system. The power is divided into ""legislative power,"" ""executive power,"" and
""judicial power,"" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each
other (self-control).

 A. Legislative Power:

 The ""Turkish Grand National Assembly"" is a parliament with one House, elected
 by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on
 behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:

 - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;
 - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;
 - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;
 - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;
 - to ratify international agreements;
 - to grant amnesty or pardons.

 Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral
 or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is
 divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is
 calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age
 of twenty-one can vote.

 Elections are supervised by the ""Supreme Council of Elections,"" which solves
 all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local ""Board of Election""
 runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the
 Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among 
 independent judges.

 B. Executive Power:

 The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government
 as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:

 - to represent the State and the Country;
 - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;
 - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;
 - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;
 - to ratify laws and government decrees.
 
 The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven
 years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may 
 call for a referendum.

 Executive power is exercised by the ""Council of Ministers,"" headed by the
 Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the
 members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval
 by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their
 program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)
 Ministers in the Council.

 Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent
 ""administrative"" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or
 functions against any law.

 C. Judicial Power:

 Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can
 instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be 
 discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the
 reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories
 of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:

 - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The 
   decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice
   upon the appeal of the parties involved.
 - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime
   Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in
   administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.
   The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the
   high administrative court.

 The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the
 ""Constitutional Court"" if they contradict the Constitution. If found
 contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.

If your Expose event handler is truly intelligent about exposed
rectangle information, then you can use XClearArea to generate an
Expose event (assuming that your background pixel is not None) for the
enclosing rectangle of your new item.

This is still not great, since any other items contained within that
rectangle will still be unnecessarily redrawn.

If your Expose event handler simply redraws everything, you'll be
doing much more work than just drawing the new item ""on top"" of the
existing scene.

Gretzky, Lemieux, Gilmour etc do not play the role of checking centreman.
They play an offensive role as opposed to a defensive one.  If they
were used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensive
abilities. 

When you compare Gretzky et al to Jarvis, Gainey etc you are comparing 
apples and oranges.  It is like me telling you that Felix Potvin isn't 
very good because a team would be better if the had Lemieux instead of
him.  Sure Lemieux is a better player, but he is a different type of
player.  For a team to be successful, they need to have all types of
players- this includes defensive forwards.

When compared with other defensive forwards, Bob Gainey is the greatest
defensive forward ever.  He is the player who's talents best suited being
a defensive forward- who completely dominated the game when he played.

Maybe if a more talented player such as Gretzky had decided to waste his
offensive talents and play defensively, he could have been a better
defensive forward, but he wasn't.

Bob Gainey is the best defensive forward that has ever played hockey.",10

for Trade 1-for-1 for movie on Beta or a used CD; or, a package deal
for $50 or whatever you care to propose in trade -- e.g., all for a
set of good stereo headphones (e.g. Sony V6 or V7), an Apple IWII
sheet feeder, a good used FM/Cassette stereo ""walkman"" or a hotel
coupon(s) for free stays FOB New York City (guests coming!)).  The
remaining collection is as follows:

         8 - Charlie X
        11 - Dagger of the Mind
        12 - Miri
        17 - Shore Leave
        20 - The Alternative Factor
        29 - Operation-Annihilate!
        33 - Who Mourns for Adonais?

Numbers indicate episode numbering on the tape boxes, for those who
are keeping track of what episodes they're missing in that manner.

RSVP for summaries, if necessary.

The tapes are all in excellent condition in the original packaging.
All have been played at least once, but most have been played ONLY
once, and NONE have been played more than twice. Running time: ~50
min. ea.  (Unedited, uncut store-bought originals unlike those in
syndication; all have *incredible* Beta HiFi sound!)

I also have the following SF and Horror movies on Beta as well; US$10
(negotiable) or Trade (1-for-1 swap for movie on Beta or a used CD):

        The Bride (Sting, Jennifer Beales)
*       Buck Rogers Conquers the Universe (Buster Crabbe, Constance Moore)

RSVP for my larger Beta movies/music trade list, or find it on Misc.forsale!

PS: For those of you who may wonder, Beta is alive as a pro/hobbyist
format ... there's life beyond the corner video store! (-;",6

Up to this point, I really thought this had been written by a 
pro-SDCN, anti-mediot poster blessed with a certain talent for
sarcasm and biting remarks.  Somebody like me, for instance.
The lurid overstatements were obviously intended to humiliate the
original poster.


But then the scales were lifted from my eyes.  Looks like Robert is
really being serious.  Oh, well.

I compare the performance of the 1992 Phillies with the 1987 edition,
which had outstanding run producers at every position except SS, yet
finished at a frustrating sub-.500 level.  The 1987 folks didn't 
ever amount to anything, and neither will the 1992 squad, IMHO.

Any other parallels with previous years' teams for this year's
editions (in the style of 1993 Braves = 1971 Orioles)?

I just got Mathcad 4.0, and the manual is not clear on the matter.  On page 8:

	:
	:

* At least 4 megabytes of memory.  All memory about 640K should be configured
  as XMS.

	:
	:
* At least 8 megabytes of virtual memory....

Common sense suggests that you should be able to run it (4+8=12 < 16) but the
new Mathcad is kinda kooky, and thus is not subject to the laws of common
sense...

 Well, if you put things into historical perspective, the Turks
 moved into an area, which was inhabited by Greeks.  This is how the history
 between the two nations started some centuries ago.  Since then, it has been
 a continuous battle between the two nations.  From my perspective I can't see
 why I should say that Greeks have been responsible for what has happened 
 between the two nations.  Of course, it would not be reasonable to argue that
 the hostility should drag till we kick the Turks out of this area.  This isn't
 going to happen, so the best would be to improve the relations between the two
 countries.  A golden oportunity exists with Cyprus.  If things can't work
 there, there isn't any possible way that could work between our nations.


 I always avoid to discuss such things.  I consider it a waist of my time.
 Besides, as I said, I do not want to open a new flame.


 I thought it was a smart move to receive more money from Greek tourists.
 I bet that this week there should be about 200,000 tourists from Greece
 in Turkey.  Each one will leave at least $1,000 so go and figure what this
 means to your economy.  If you had kept the visa requirement, how many
 Greeks would bother to visit Turkey?


 Come on. Do not extrapolate from your limited personal experience.  You err
 if you think you'd get a reasonable conclusion.

I think the three-headed GM's guiding principle was to keep veterans
in favor of youngsters only if they offered a ""significant"" advantage.
At the end of last season, the contracts of several veterans with somewhat
maginal contributions (Fenton, Bozek, Anderson, and a couple others I
can't remember) were bought out. The idea was that youngsters could
play almost as well, and had the potential to improve where these
older guys did not. 
And they traded Mullen, because he wanted to go, not because he
wasn't good enough, but I think they were a bit too optimistic
in thinking they could make up for his contributions.
An example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis
but not kept, because of his age. I thought he was a decent
contributor worth keeping around.

The youth movement has its advantages; look at Gaudreau who
might still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around. But
you have to find the right balance.",10

Well, yes and no.  I don't particularly want this discussion to spark
a lengthy debate, but I do think it's worth pointing out that ""popular
usage"" is not always sufficient excuse.  

In this case, for example, I think an appropriate parallel may be found
in the pronunciation of proper names: if people commonly misspelled or 
mispronounced your name, would you feel compelled to change it?  Probably
not.  

The same is true of X.  ""The X Window System"", ""X"", ""X11"", and related
monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a
proper name.  In fact, some of them are *trademarked* names.  The fact 
that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point.  

As for the trade publications that promulgate things like ""X Window"" or
""X.windows"" or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees, 
consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by 
*journalists*.  Would you trust the facts of a journalist who couldn't
be bothered to get the name of his/her source right?  Would you trust
a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong?

Popular usage is as it may be, but I for one am all for holding people
who claim to be journalists to a higher standard of correctness.

"I can't help myself.
I've tried to be rational, 
to look the other way,
but everytime it happens, 
its uncontrollable.

I hate pre'80s motorcycles.

At first I thought it was a phase.  I though I would
get used to them.  It didn't happen.  I tried gazing
at CB750s and 900 customs, but each time I sadistically
pictured them being hurled off of large precipice
(I also picture a swarm of german tourists cheering and
taking holiday snaps, but I can't figure that part out).

What am I to do?  Everytime I read a .sig containing 
some spoked wheel wonder, I shudder and feel pity that
the poor soul has suffered enough.  I imagine the owner
scrapping out his (or her) living in a discarded Maytag
refridgerator box, tucked in next to their CX500.

I'm hoping for some deliverance.  I had in the past loathed
the Milwaukee machine, but I can actually begin to understand
some of the preaching.  There must be hope.

X
X    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules:
X
X    1) Your entry must be a complete program.
X
X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters
X       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or }
X       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536.
X
X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format:
X
X---entry---
Xrule:	1993
Xfix:	y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry)
Xtitle:	title of entry  		    (see comments below)
Xentry:	Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0)
Xdate:	Date/time of submission in UTC	    (see comments below)
Xhost:	Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested
X	Use tab indented lines if needed
X---remark---
X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if
X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a
X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th
X    column.  Blank lines are permitted.
X---author---
Xname:	your name
Xorg:	School/Company/Organization
Xaddr:	postal address
X	use tab indented lines to continue
X	don't forget to include the country
Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain.
X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.
Xanon:	y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info)
X---info---
XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in
Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info
Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.
X---build---
XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program
Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting
Xfile must be 255 bytes or less.
X---program---
XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode
Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2.
X---end---
X
X      Regarding the above format:
X
X	* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]*
X	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.
X
X	  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should
X	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,
X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.
X
X	* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect
X	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() 
X	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)
X
X	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending
X	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the 
X	  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same 
X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be 
X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.
X
X	* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above 
X	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges
X	  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate
X	  Email message to the judges.
X
X	* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless 
X	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line.
X
X	* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for
X	  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and
X	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.
X
X	* The entry's remarks should include:
X	    - what this program does
X	    - how to run the program (sample args or input)
X	    - special compile or execution instructions, if any
X	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)
X	    - information about any ---data--- files
X	    - why you think the program is obfuscated
X	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.
X	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)
X
X	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain
X	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.
X
X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They 
X	  should not be required to exist.
X
X	  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---
X	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple 
X	  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe
X	  each info file in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:
X
X	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed
X	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional
X	       digit, followed by '.c'
X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's
X	       title, possibly followed by a digit
X
X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your
X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a
X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of
X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed
X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.
X
X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must
X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.
X
X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be
X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,
X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this
X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.
X
X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.
X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not 
X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.
X
X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the
X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.
X
X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is
X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to:
X
X		...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate
X		obfuscate@toad.com
X
X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'.
X
X       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries
X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however.
X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for
X       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.
X
X    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry
X       must be sent in a separate Email letter.
X
X   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.  
X       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed.
X
X   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user,
X       special owner or group) are not allowed.
X

X10th International Obfuscated C Code Contest Guidelines, Hints and Comments
X
XCopyright (c) Landon Curt Noll & Larry Bassel, 1993.  
XAll Rights Reserved.  Permission for personal, education or non-profit use is 
Xgranted provided this this copyright and notice are included in its entirety 
Xand remains unaltered.  All other uses must receive prior permission in writing

X
XABOUT THIS FILE:
X
X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to
X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short).
X
X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about
X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.
X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are
X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.
X
X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.
X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.
X
X
XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:
X
X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c
X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.
X
X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C
X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers 
X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with 
X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor 
X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.
X
X
XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:
X
X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See
X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.
X
X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries
X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year
X    might be 'old' the next year.
X
X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply
X    a number of tests to an entry:
X
X	* look at the original source
X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII
X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines
X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines
X	* run it through a C beautifier
X	* examine the algorithm
X	* lint it
X	* compile it
X	* execute it
X
X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.
X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been
X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.
X
X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain
X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the
X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as
X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given
X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that
X    does something interesting when you run it.
X
X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave
X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life
X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the
X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.
X
X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know
X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse
X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the
X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to
X    annoy more than amuse.
X
X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries
X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'
X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use
X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)
X
X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make
X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly
X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some
X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.
X
X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that
X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off
X    documenting it.  Noting ""this entry sometimes prints the 4th power
X    of a prime by mistake"" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,
X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly
X    working entry is best.
X
X
XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:
X
X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We
X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests
X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far
X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.
X
X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:
X
X	#define d define
X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo
X
X	int i;
X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration
X	int k;
X
X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you 
X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in 
X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.
X
X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.
X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:
X
X	int i;
X	char *c;
X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead
X	(i+3)[""string""];   <--- use ""string""[i+3] instead
X
X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of
X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety
X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are
X    not portable and must not be used:
X
X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable
X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable
X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg
X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg
X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables
X	* using va_list as a structure or union
X
X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.
X
X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.
X
X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),
X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some
X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.
X
X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries
X    must not assume that it returns an int.
X
X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.
X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do
X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people
X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for
X    programs that are compact, and are instructional.
X
X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80
X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.
X
X    We tend to dislike programs that:
X
X	* are very hardware specific
X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific
X	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific
X	      code is likely not to be)
X	* dump core or have compiler warnings
X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)
X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x
X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit
X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs
X	* are longer than they need to be
X	* are similar to previous winners
X	* are identical to previous losers  :-)
X
X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the
X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program
X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.
X
X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size
X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,
X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to
X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel
X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off
X    if you show some amount of restraint.
X
X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact
X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get
X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.
X
X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob
X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C
X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third
X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!
X
X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'
X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim
X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating
X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.
X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)
X    know of a smaller one!
X
X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that
X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't
X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend
X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.
X
X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and
X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client
X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the
X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).
X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone
X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not
X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or
X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better
X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.
X
X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on
X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines
X    in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    We like programs that:
X
X	* are as concise and small as they need to be
X	* do something at least quasi-interesting
X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)
X	* are portable
X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style
X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION
X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)
X
X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your
X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several
X    areas really does help.
X
X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in
X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to
X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.
X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.
X
X    Be creative!
X
X
XENTRY FORMAT:
X
X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your
X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,
X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the
X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)
X
X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to
X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that
X    is found in mkentry.c:
X
X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every
X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces
X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,
X	where this program differs from the contest rules, the
X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the
X	contest rules before submitting an entry.
X
X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,
X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check
X    the entry against the size rules.
X
X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about
X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below)
X
X    The following is a sample entry:
X
X---entry---
Xrule:	1993
Xfix:	n
Xtitle:	chonglab
Xentry:	0
Xdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993
Xhost:	Un*x v6, pdp11/45
X	2.9BSD, pdp11/70
X---remark---
X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.
X
X    It is likely not to win a prize.  But what do you expect from
X    a short example!

X
X    Typically the build file should assume that the source is prog.c
X    and will compile into prog.  If an entry wins, we will rename
X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,
X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional
X    digit in case of name conflicts.
X
X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,
X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.
X
X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source
X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the
X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful
X    if you did one of the following:
X
X	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.
X
X	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:
X
X		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary
X
X	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source
X		cp prog.c special_src.c
X		cc special_src.c -o special_name
X
X	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build
X		tail +4 build > special_build
X		sh < special_build
X
X	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of 
X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You 
X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.
X
X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,
X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid
X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should
X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This
X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.
X
X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We
X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the
X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them
X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,
X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,
X    then skip the ---info--- section.
X
X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that
X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an
X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample
X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a
X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a
X    'hints' file.
X
X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For
X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed
X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,
X    the entry should not require them exist.
X
X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name
X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,
X    say so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they
X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say
X    so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has
X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should
X    have entry number 0.
X
X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry
X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the
X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't
X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the 
X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:
X
X	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for
X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries)
X    
X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer 
X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as 
X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:
X
X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993
X
X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The
X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many 
X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:
X
X	date -u ""+%a %h %d %T 19%y""
X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/'
X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""'
X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""'
X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""'
X
X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set
X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.
X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number
X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be
X    replaced.
X
X
XJUDGING PROCESS:
X
X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.
X
X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message
X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:
X
X	---entry--- section
X	all ---author--- sections
X	all ---info--- sections
X	---build--- section
X	---program--- section
X	any other text, including the Email message headers
X
X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure
X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was
X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the
X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is
X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.
X
X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular
X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are
X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding
X    out in the end, who won and where they were from.
X
X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.
X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all
X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning
X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even
X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,
X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC
X    winners at talks)
X
X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the
X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give
X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their
X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We
X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.
X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.
X
X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,
X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;
X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does
X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the
X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.
X
X    A reading consists of a number of actions:
X
X	* reading the ---entry--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any
X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor
X	    shipping over any #include files
X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source
X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor
X	    shipping over any #include files
X
X    In later rounds, other actions are performed:
X
X	* linting the source
X	* compiling/building the source
X	* running the program
X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary
X
X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries
X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it
X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.
X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form
X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.
X    An entry often will compete in several categories.
X
X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries
X    we receive.  A typical category list might be:
X
X	* best small one line program
X	* best small program
X	* strangest/most creative source layout
X	* most useful obfuscated program
X	* best game that is obfuscated
X	* most creatively obfuscated program
X	* most deceptive C code
X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)
X	* best abuse of ANSI C
X	* worst abuse of the rules
X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>
X
X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so
X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.
X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.
X
X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of
X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10
X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into
X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is
X    less clear cut.
X
X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out
X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is
X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry 
X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, 
X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!
X
X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a
X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest
X    rules in some way.
X
X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such
X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the
X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.
X
X
XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:
X
X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,
X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to
X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.
X
X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:
X
X	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources
X
X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following
X
X	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc
X	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x
X
X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See
X    below for details.
X
X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners 
X    have appeared in books (""The New Hackers Dictionary"") and on T-Shirts.
X
X    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)

4.  Baltimore Orioles - Pitching, but Devareaux, Anderson, and Hoiles will drop
5.  Cleveland Indians - Still don't seem to know what they are doing
6.  Detroit Tigers - All key players but Fryman are another year past peak
7.  Boston Red Sox - Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than 7th

Al West - this division was the toughest for me to pick.  Whoever of the top
          4 gets pitching should win it.
1.  Minnesota Twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success
2.  Texas Rangers - I don't know why I have them here.  Jose Canseco?
3.  Chicago White Sox - Frank Thomas but no pitching.
4.  Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close
5.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here
6.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs
7.  California Angels - will win no games

NL East
1.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach!
2.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga
3.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected
4.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a ""team""
5.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me
6.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing
7.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doing

NL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division.
1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern
2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all
3.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to 4 than 2
4.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 1993
5.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants
6.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink
7.  Colorado Rockies - will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL.


NLCS  Montreal d. Atlanta  (Braves fans, yes I'm probably contradicting
                            what I said in my NL West comment.)
ALCS  New York d. Minnesota

World Series  New York d. Montreal - Hating the Yankees will be
                                     fashionable again

NL MVP:  Barry Bonds, or maybe McGriff
NL Cy Young:  Jose Rijo
AL MVP:  Frank Thomas will deserve it (again), but Fielder might win it
AL Cy Young:  Roger Clemens (at least will deserve it (again))

"From another space forum
    When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS-56
 solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers
 lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB.  The tool survived
 the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot
 altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.

    NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,

    ""It's been a long time since something like this happened.  We've
 lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this.""

    The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a
 Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on
 April 2nd.  Unfortunately, the worker's supervisor did not act on the
 report and Discovery was launched with its ""extra payload"".  NASA
 officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th
 launch date.

    The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB
 technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster,
 its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a
 part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.

    A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that
 the Shuttle processor will take ""appropriate action"".  Thiokol is a
 subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for launch.

Source: Edward K. Boghosian, ""Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity
Meeting,"" The Armenian Reporter, May 1, 1986, pp. 1 & 18.

ATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties,
including the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both
Armenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the 
Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new
Armenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during
the 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And
judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these
political groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian
Cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.

The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of
the Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed
by younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the
armed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia
(ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern
countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to
have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks
of ASALA...

Voicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian
people, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of
the party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal...
Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement 
was Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam 
Abu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued 
support of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause, 
pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be 
open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr. 
Abu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that 
his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that
this policy will continue. ""The doors of our camps are always open to 
Armenian freedom fighters,"" he affirmed.

Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son
of Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet;
two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the
specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of
the Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist
party, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations,
a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the
European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among
those who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow
the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.

More than significant was the large number of messages received by the 
organizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary
Movement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation
Movement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist
Labor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other
international groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict.

                 SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM

Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary
Federation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction
and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to
foreign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the
Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will
continue to ""reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,""
to expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag ""Bureau.""
The message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that
exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement,
open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.

The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the
Greek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence.
The headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have
turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who
prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...

n>crap posted by Mr. [(*]!
 
 o boy!   
 
 Please, can you tell us why those quotes are ""crap""?..because you do not 
 like them!!!...because they really exist...why?
 
 As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source 
 given by Serdar Argic .. 
  
 You couldn't reject it...
 
 
 Here we go again..
 In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give 
 the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!
 (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of
 pages, please ask by sct) 
 
 
I really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)
What I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in
the given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your
groundless accussations, etc. 
 
[...]
 
 
 I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)
 and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published
 in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you
 are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..
 
 Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)
 
 First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You
 called Serdar Argic a liar!..
 I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...
 (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)
 
 And now, you are lying again and talking about ""modified,re-published book""
(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..
 (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was
  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty 
  well suited theories', as usual)
 
 And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who
 wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number
 and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  
                 949.6 R 198
   
  and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215
              
     
 
 
 Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying ""it is
 not possible..."" ..If not, what is your point?
 
 Differences in the number of pages?
 Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..
 No need to use the same book size and the same letter 
 charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!
 
 The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year
 first published.. 
 And you tried to hide the whole point..
 the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about
 how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given 
 by Serdar Argic exist!! 
 It was the issue, wasn't-it?  
 
 you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway? 
 
 You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a ""crap""..
 People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still
 has so many ""craps"" in the 1993. 
 
 Any question?

upcoming bimmer 530/540i would it?  maybe they can use a 3.6 liter
version to avoid conflicts with the v8 model.. then strip off all the
luxo-garbage.  let the S4 remain with the flared arches and fat tires
to go fight with the M5.... maybe turn up the boost a wee bit to bump

"Forwarded from Neal Ausman, Galileo Mission Director

                                GALILEO
                     MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT
                             POST-LAUNCH
                         April 9 - 15, 1993

SPACECRAFT

1.  On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire
celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)
swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.

2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked
to the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity
from April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay
Antenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to
11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.

3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss
timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.

4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer
(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly.

5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify
the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment
data; long term trend analysis is continuing.

6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the
optimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary
analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation
index is near the optimal level.

7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.
Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.

8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster
flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed
during the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.

9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant
changes (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads
19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These
measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special
anomaly team.

10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:

       a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts
       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin
       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner
       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees
           off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)
       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1
       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within
           acceptable range
       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range
       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,
           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS
       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within
           acceptable range
       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours
           Time To Initiation - 260 hours


GDS (Ground Data Systems):

1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test
for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21
(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify
the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller
(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement
for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry
rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry
Subsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The
10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was
not metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS
data from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of
the TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.


TRAJECTORY

     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory
status was as follows:

	Distance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)
	Distance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)
	Heliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour
	Distance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km
	Round Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds

	I don't think we need to coin a term like ""Jedeo-Nazism"" to
refer to those Jews who, in their endless desire to be accepted by the
Nazis, do their dirty work for them.  We can just call them house
Jews, fools, or anti-Semites from Jewish families.

	I think ""house Jews,"" a reference to a person of Jewish

I suppose that depends on how you define 'vast' majority....

You are correct about 'majority.'  Somewhere between 1 out of three and 
one out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent 
assault.  The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems
like heart attack and stroke.

'Vast' is probably too loose a term.  With approximately 1,000,000 Americans
using firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some
may have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in 
using firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population.
(Yes, I know that is a REAL rough estimate.  We're closer to 270 million now, 
but many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentage
if anything is low.)

At any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred 
to as 'tiny' minorities, so I don't see how the other part of the group 
can be referred to as the 'vast' majority.  A little more work might 
support a 'simple' majority of Americans never use, own or display a firearm.

Certainly when you are talking about OWNERSHIP you are wrong.  Nearly half
of your fellow citizens own one or more firearms.  


Please provide a list of other means that are as effective.  Then you might 
convince your local police departments to switch.  Good luck.",16

The funny thing is the personaly stories about reactions to MSG vary so
greatly. Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face. Some
claim their heart ""skipped"" beats once in a while. Some reacted with
headache, some stomach ache. Some had watery eyes or running nose, some
had itchy skin or rashes. More serious accusations include respiration 
difficulty and brain damage. 

Now here is a new one: vomiting. My guess is that MSG becomes the number one

It comes with a Cirrus Logic VLB card which has 2Mb RAM onboard.
It can do true-color but I don't know what type of card it is.
I read that Cirrus Logic cards aren't exactly the fastes around.

My old system had a TSENG 4000. I was pretty pleased with it, so I
consider buying a W32/TSENG card. I'd like to know a few things:

	- How is the speed/performance in DOS/Windows/Unix/OS/2
	  Graphics & Text (also compared to S3 cards for example)
	- What resolutions (including no. of colors) does it
	  support (text & graphics)
	- How many RAM can be installed and what type of RAM
	- Compatibility with old TSENG 4000
	- Support in software

If anyone has any experience with this card (good or bad) I'd like
to know. If you have a better alternative than the W32 please tell
me about it.


For the people in Holland:
Kan iemand me misschien vertellen waar de W32 in Nederland te verkrijg
is? Het liefst in de omgeving van Amsterdam!

"April 13, 1993 response by Al Moore (L629159@LMSC5.IS.LMSC.LOCKHEED.COM):

Basically the problem is that Israel may remain, or leave, the occupied 
territories; it cannot do both, it cannot do neither. So far, Israe 
continues to propose that they remain. The Palestinians propose that they 
leave. Why should either change their view? It is worth pointing out that 
the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a
reduction in the Israeli presence. Israel proposes no such reduction....
and in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tim: 

There seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. The
first is that of Israel, where there is little trust for Arab groups, so
there is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in 
exchange for pieces of paper, ""expectations"", ""hopes"", etc. The second
is that of the Arab world/Palestinians, where there is the demand that
these ""tangible concessions"" be made by Israel **without** it receiving
anything **tangible** back.  Given this, the gap between the two stances
seems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns
for its expected concessions. By ""tangible"" is meant something that
1) provides Israel with ""comparable"" protection (from the land it is to 
give up), 2) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine 
**will be** accountable and held actively (not just ""diplomatically) 
responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens 
or ""visitors"").

In essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinian
statehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israel
was assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to** 
co-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel 
from its territory.
	Aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,
	how *could* such ""guarantees"" be instilled? For example,
	how could such ""guarantees""/""controls"" be added to the
	Palestinian PISGA proposals?

Israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute
it lets go (gives lands back to Arab states, no more ""buffer zone"", gives
full autonomy to Palestinians), ANY and/or ALL of the Arab parties
could (and *would*, if not ""controlled"" somehow) EASILY return to the 
traditional anti-Israel position. The question then is HOW to *really*
ensure that that will not happen.",17

Oops, sorry, my words, not the words of the Qur'an.


Note that ""(the celestial bodies)"" in the above verse is an
interpolation (which is why it is in brackets) -- it is the translator's 
(incorrect, IMHO) interpretation.

Here is Maurice Bucaille's translation (he studied Arabic for his
research into the Qur'an and science) of this verse:

""(God is) the One Who created the night, the day, the sun and the moon.
Each is travelling in an orbit with its own motion."" (Qur'an :33)

The positive aspect of this verse noted by Dr. Maurice Bucaille is that
while geocentrism was the commonly accepted notion at the time (and for
a long time afterwards), there is no notion of geocentrism in this verse
(or anywhere in the Qur'an).",0

I am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling
or perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points.
However, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the
people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I
feel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to
go but that they would deserve it more. 

IMHO 
Dave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he
could hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not
think he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the
game. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I
still would not back him for the Hall of Fame.

Dave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several
season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are
(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a
bit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other
people but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial
contributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are
some of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he
was with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to
and while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I
think it deserves some consideration.

Lee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would
deserve to go before the likes of Kingman.

Darrell Evans - No.

Eddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although
a silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not
sure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both
the average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just
think, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.

Jeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the
top of my head I would take Lee Smith first.


Well, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I
talked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been
instumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very
good offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers
offensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for
every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have
shattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved
games? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a
game? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more
than numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).
Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does
George Brett who also belongs in this class of player.


Steve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone
making a case for him. 

Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might
bring up his name.

Kirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still
has time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my
probably will turn into a definately.

Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him
having some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not
hear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the
contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would
not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even
top 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame
because of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -
even with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL
the possible votes.

So in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do
but I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least
not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.

Yes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan
Maybe - Murray and L. Smith
No - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman

As I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this
up - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.",9

    No. The LAPD officers were tried first by the State of California
on charges of police brutality, and secondly by the Federal Government
on depriving RK of his civil rights - a different crime.

    The scenario I outline is more similar to the Oliver North trial.
Ollie confessed to treason (aiding an enemy of the US) during Senate
hearings, under immunity. The team which was later to prosecute him on
criminal charges had to sequester itself from all reports of ON's
immunized testimony. ON's lawyer brought up the probability that at
least someone on the team had heard about the Senate testimony, and it
was a strong factor against the prosecution, which is one of the
reasons this ON is still walking around free today.",11
"
Without getting into the *really* *thorny* questions about reverse
engineering and all of that, let me just point out that there already
exist gate arrays and suchlike that have what's known as a security fuse
which can be programmed after you've verified all other programming --
this makes it impossible to read out the programming of the device
(again, ignoring the reverse engineering questions).  Speaking from
experience here: I had to completely reinvent one of my designs some
six or seven years ago when the disk file was zapped, the backups were
all bad, and the devices were unreadable because of the security fuses.
Made me appreciate the value of printouts.  ;-)

So on this point at least there's not so much worry.

But whether or not we can get the chips made reliably and securely is
really secondary to the question of whether use of the chip is itself
likely to be secure, methinks.",11

Having thought about this, why don't you project the 2 lines onto the 2d
plane formed by the lines.  Do an intersection calculation in the plane in
2D, where you're guaranteed a unique solution (unless they're parallel which
won't happen in this case), and then use parametric distance along the lines
from the circle centres to determine the exact point of interest.  This
bypasses the messy error propogation required to do the calculation in 3d.

Hope I haven't put my foot in it again!

While that is currently true from their perspective, it is also
worthwhile to note that in such cases the populace often does suffer
from attempts to control the guerillas.  Furthermore, there were
cases in the past of Palestinian gun emplacements being situated
within villages.  The argument that can be made for small arms
fire can not be made for field pieces.


As I recall, Amal was primarily nationalistically ""Lebanon for
the Lebanese"" motivated.  I think that the difference between them
was also a matter of funding and support.  One question does
come to mind however, 

Given that you claim the Hizbollah to be more committed etc... and
that their stated position is:
	1.  No peace talks.
	2.  No peace talks.
	.
	.
	.
	.
	N-1. No peace talks.
	N.  No Israel

if we assume that Lebanon and Syria are sincere in their desire for
peace, why hasn't the Hizbollah been disarmed?


Bearing in mind the above and that military losses are more palatable
than civilian ones, I am sure you can understand why Israel is slow
to act in that manner.


I agree that Syria wants Lebanon to be part of its greater Syria.
I don't necessarily see that the Syrians would be unhappy to see
Israel up to its neck in another Lebanese morass afterwhich Syria
could continue on its merry schedule when Israeli public opinion
would lead to a second pullout.

I have the same problem and was about to post this....

Hello duo owners (and Apple technical people :-)
 
I have a new duo 230 which appears to have a problem waking up from
sleep when running on battery power. When woken (usually for the second
time) after sleeping, the wake fails and the screen appears with a
corrupted image of broken horizontal lines and control can only be
recovered with control-command-poweron or the reset key at the back of
the machine. The problem occurs even when the system is stock standard
(no extensions, no virtual memory, a fully charged new battery, system 7.1
etc). I have not had the problem when the machine is plugged in to AC.
I've checked that the battery is properly seated (it appears to be fine).
 
What's going on here ? Anyone else had this problem ? Is it software or
hardware ? 
 
If you have a duo 230 and a bit of time, try repeatedly sleeping and
waking the machine on battery power and let me know if you see the same
behaviour (and let Apple know too !).
 
Many thanks to anyone who can clear this one up for me.

"Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?

A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative.

Congress??  So we're playing politics before we talk to CPSR, academia,
the public, internet users?  I`ve heard of top-down design, but top-down 
democracy?? [Just whose state/district are the chip manufacturers in?]

Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices?

A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review. [...bs about
     the wonderfulness of the key escrow system...]

     The Administration is not saying, ""since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
     we will prohibit it outright"" (as some countries have
     effectively done); 

They'll just provide an easily-compromised version to JQ Public.

                         nor is the U.S. saying that ""every
     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product.""  

Maybe we need a CRA -- Cryptographic Rights Amendment.

                                                  There is a
     false ""tension"" created in the assessment that this issue is
     an ""either-or"" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,
     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the ""Clipper
     Chip"" and similar encryption techniques.

Why repeat themselves?  It appears to some (and the story looks pretty

If you need just to change the wallpaper, then I've written a short
program in VB that does this by using SystemParametersInfo-function.
The bad news is that you need VBRUN200.DLL to run it, and the DLL is
some 350kb (the program is about 7kb). The order of pictures depends
on the system date and the number of BMP-files in the directory, so
the picture remains the same if you execute the program multiple times
during the same day and the number of BMPs has not changed.

If you feel this is what you need then I could uuencode it and email

Even if there was no independent proof that Luke's account was
valid, I find it strange that you would take the negation of it as
truth without any direct historical evidence (at least that you've
mentioned) to back it up.  The assertion was made, unequivocally
that no Christian ever sufferred for their faith by believing in
the Resurrection.  Luke's account suggests otherwise, and in the
absence of direct eyewitnesses who can claim that Luke is mistaken,
then I suggest that this unequivocal assertion is suspect.

this.  It was an answer to the claim that the witnesses couldn't
be lying because they were willign to suffer for their beliefs.
Thus it's not necessary to show that no Christian ever suffered

I think Murray has done a great job.  He's picked up Ciccarelli,
Sheppard, Ysebaert, Howe, Coffey, and Riendeau (plus some depth players) 
without giving up anything the Wings needed or any of his top prospects.
All of this in three years.  Has anyone done better?

The year before he took over, the Wings didn't even make the playoffs.
There was about a year and a half during Demers' stint that the Wings
did OK, but that was due to Demers' motavational skills and clutch
and grab style.  They didn't have much talent.

Gerald, Murray wasn't responsible for Primeau (although I'm not

Ok, so there are in fact two distinct components transmitted by the
chip; the real message encrypted with the ""conventional"" key, and the
serial number and encrypted ""conventional"" key encrypted with the
(IMHO kind of bogus, as the whole concept of ""one key that millions of
people use which can't be changed"" doesn't seem reasonable) ""family
key"".

Suppose I analyze the output of this chip and I'm able to determine
which bits are the encrypted packet which contains the serial number
and session key.  Suppose I also design a simple algorithm based on
this information which takes the data containing the encrypted session
key and twiddles a bit (or several) before it's sent down the line.

Mind you, I'm sure the NSA thought of this along with a dozen other
attacks I can't imagine, and the system is probably somehow designed
so that manipulation of this information will cause a compliant
receiving chip to somehow fail to decrypt successfully.  But how?
What if the two parties agree in advance on some kind of consistent
bit-twiddling scheme, so the decryption chip sees the restored
""proper"" bitstream but an eavesdropper gets a E[K; UK] packet that's
wrong?

I suppose this could be easily defeated if the chip ""sends"" that
information out many times in slightly different ways, making it
effectively impossible to be certain you know all the information

"Hi Netters,

As promised, here are the summary of opinions on DoubleDisk Gold v.6.0.
People seem to be quite happy with the product. There is no much of
opinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0.
(Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although
just as reliable - BYTE Magazine's conclusion ;-) ), so it's hard to make
any decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. 
However, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy.

Hello Buddy,

I do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have
DD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.

Here is my suggestion...

1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with
	DOS 6.0's compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that
	for $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other
	utilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you 
	are now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)

2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95
	for the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I
	decided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!
	I have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with
	large SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It
	works great.  Not delays.  I think the ""A"" is better than ""B"" 
	arguements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.
	I am looking forward to being able to ""LOADHIGH"" the DD sw.  That
	has been an annoyance.

3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the
	effort to upgrade.

Just my $.02 ...

Regards,
Mark Bagdy

Buddy,

I got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The
documentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic
installation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.

There were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max
& QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a
203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had
~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows
swap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and
such).

I have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it
takes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very
happy camper.

	I have been using DoubleDisk Gold for a little more than a month on
a 486DX 33Mhz, 120MB Seagate drive, running DOS & Windows in 386 enhanced
mode.
	I ran some tests and concluded that the speed of a DoubleDisk drive
with a drive read cache is about equal to the bare drive without a cache.
	I have no complaints about reliability.  It was very easy to install.
The only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game
was trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed
region of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem. 
There was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive.
	Compression performance for the whole disk has held steady 
around 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files 
are compressed image files and some large zip files.  

If you have any more specific questions let me know.

What I'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections
are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect? I don't want

You're assuming that the low-cost delivery system has to be a separate

your contest entry, than to try to do it with existing launchers.  No
other demand is necessary.


You're assuming that it's going to take a decade to build a new launch
system.  But why?  The Saturn V took less than six years, depending on
exactly when you date its start.  Pegasus took about three from project
start to first flight.  Before SDIO chickened out on orbital development,
the target date for an orbital DC-Y flight was 1996.  If you really want

Let's see if I have this straight.  A law is created that says ""you can not
have a automatic weapon"" and therefore it's ok for the government to use
any level of force to enforce that law.  Doesn't matter if the entire 
population of the planet is destroyed as long as that law is obeyed.",16
"I'm looking to build a microphone preamp that has very good low-noise characteristics,  large clean gain, and incorportates phantom power (20-48 volts (dc)) for a PZM microphone.  I'm leaning towards a good, low-cost (??) instrumentation amplifier to maintain the balanced input from the microphone, for its good CMRR, internal compensation, and because i can use a minimal # of parts.  

Does anyone out there have any experience, suggestions, advice, etc...that they'd like to pass on, I'd greatly appreciate it.

I told a newbie friend of mine, who was having trouble from the complicated

not to turn. Push the right handlebar ""down"" (or pull left up or whatever)
to lean right. It worked for him, he stopped steering with his tuchus.",8

I think you need the EMM386.EXE noems
This will let the expanded mem be active but not use any, therefore
this will give you more extended mem for windows yet have all the

Hi,

I'm kind of new at the pc stuff.  My machine has 4 serial ports.  Com 1 and3
and 2 &4 share same IRQs.  You mean I can't plug a mouse into Com1 and a modem
into com3 and expect both to work?

If Answer is NO, should I change IRQ's for com ports to be different?  And,
does it really matter which IRQ I set the ports too?

[not very comprehensive list deleted]

There is a very comprehensive list in sci.math.symbolic, 
which detailed descriptions of many packages. 
(Especially you, Mark, should update your list :-) )
Here it is: 


			Available    Systems

This is the  list of  currently  developed  and   distributed  software  for 
symbolic math applications. No informations is supplied on systems no longer 
being supported like: SAINT, FORMAC, ALPAK, ALTRAN, MATHLAB, SIN, SAC, CAMAL, 
ScratchPad, MuMath, SHEEP, TRIGMAN, ANALITIK, SMP or CCALC.

For more detailed info on any of the systems below,  look into the directory
pub/Symbolic_Math in the anonymous FTP of ""math.berkeley.edu"". No particular 
recommendation is made for any of these.      If you want prices contact the 
company. Programs are listed by (aprox.) the reverse order of the number  of 
machines they run on, in each class, general purpose systems first.

If you have any information to add to this list (we know we are missing
MuPAD & FELIX) please send it to :

Really?  How do you avoid situations which encourage criminals?  I'd
really like to know.  Would you, say, prohibit female college
students from riding their bicycles near the university during the
daytime?  

Sounds a bit drastic, doesn't it?  Especially when the university is
locatd in a nice residential area.  A friend of mine was attacked and
nearly raped in just this situation.  The police didn't feel she was
in a situation which 'encouraged criminals'.

What do you think?  Should we just tell her, that it was her fault
for daring to ride a bicycle in the middle of the day?  That she
didn't avoid a situation that encouraged criminals?  If that's the
case, then we'd all better put bars on our doors and windows and
pray for a police state to keep us all safe.  Crime happens in all
situations - there are no defined areas that criminals avoid.  ",16

It depends.  If you can get your old veterans cheap, and if they can perform
at a higher level than your young talent can *now*, why not the talent

If the veterans are gone in a year or two -- that should be just about right.

"Well, I dropped by the library yesterday, and picked up back copies
of the National Crime Survey (1986-1990) in an effort to examine what
it said about self-defense with a firearm.

      I haven't ground through much in the way of numbers yet, but a couple
of things jumped out at me.  First only 1986 and 1987 specify the type of
weapon used in self defense.  1988, 1989, and 1990 refer only to ""weapon.""
The second is that while assaults rose about 3% from 1986 to 1987, w/gun
defenses reported *fell* by almost 25%.  Unless there's an explanation for
this, I'm tempted to mark it as a reporting problem, and as such going 
ahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time.

      Anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference, and
not just a reporting difference?  The survey doesn't appear to have
changed significantly between 1986 and 1987.

Atoms are not objective.  They aren't even real.  What scientists call
an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes 
certain physical, observable properties of our surroundings.  All
of which is subjective.  

What is objective, though, is the approach a scientist 
takes in discussing his model and his observations.  There
is no objective science.  But there is an objective approach
which is subjectively selected by the scientist.  Objective
in this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules that
he and his colleagues use to discuss their science.

This is in contrast to your Objective Morality.  There may be an
objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on
morality.  But there exists no objective morality.

Also, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of 
the physical world around us.  In that the method of discussion
is objective ( not the science; not the discussion itself ).

Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes
of what we can observe.  It simply gives us a way to discuss our
surroundings in a meaningful, consistent way.

we can _say_ about the physical world.",19

  plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.

  Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
  time per game and some measure of its ""quality"" (i.e., is the player put out
  in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up
  against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would
  much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious
  merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.

IMHO = in my humble opinion!!







I didn't say there was no value - all I said was that it is very confusing
to newbies. 


Bill, you are kidding yourself here. Firstly, motorcycles do not steer
themselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly, it is the adhesion of the
tyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the
 motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and
not the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. Are you seriously
suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster
or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise??



Formal training in this country (as far as I am aware) does not include
countersteering theory.  I found out about countersteering about six years ago,
from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. I didn't believe him
at first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left,
but I went out and analysed closely what I was doing, and realized he was 
right! It's an interesting bit of knowledge, and I've had a lot of fun since
then telling others about it, who were at first as sceptical as I was. But
that's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that
it is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster
or better as a result, is absurd.

Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to
be able to ride a bike properly and safely. But by including countersteering
theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at
the time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.
And that was my original point.",8

	Yes.  But the point is that prices are competetive.  Saturn may
well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a $2000 profit, but 
since a comperable Honda with $500 profit is more expensive, it may be well
worth it to buy the Saturn.





	Not necessarily.  It seems to me that Saturn salesdroids, who don't 
make a commision, whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally
do, make more $$ per hour or whatever.  This means that Saturn doesn't give up
the profit to their employees through commision, which IS taken out of per-
car profits.  They just pass it along to less pressureing salesmen/women.


	Maybe.  Maybe not.  Depends on accounting practices.  I'd rather pay
more for dealer service that doesn't cut corners to contain costs...

"From my rather rusty knowledge of radio, most radio receivers use a superhet 
circuit, so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator, giving 
a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) that is more easily amplified. The
detector detectors work by picking up IF re-radiated from your radar 
detector. In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there 
are/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't 
paid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the
roof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF. 

I wonder how much of the IF is radiated back from the detector antenna, and 
how much from the rest of the module. It might be worth putting the detector 
in a proper RF shielded enclosure.

-------------------------------------------------
Kings 6 @ Calgary Flames 3 - 04/18/93

The third place Kings opened the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs in Calgary, against
the second place Flames and came out with an impressive 6-3 victory in front of
a non-sellout crowd of 18,605 at the Saddledome in Calgary.

Symthe Division playoff hockey this was.  Both teams seemed a bit tense in the
opening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got
into the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out-
standing team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record
their first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on
penalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play 
and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had
their problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10
tries.

The Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the
blue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the 
Flames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex-
pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse
in his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to 
the dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this 
morning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.

1st period: 
1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won
the draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the
puck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the
far side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He
put the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up
in 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where
Sydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the 
hash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.

Millen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings
failed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert.
Dahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30
second 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in
the period.

2nd period: 
The Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed
to convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into
the stands and received a delay of game.

1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the
puck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit 
the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated 
down the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and
skated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him 
and he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.

2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play.
Shuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed
for the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot 
where 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson
came from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot
between the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.

3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off
the puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass
cross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot,
beating a diving Vernon on the glove side.

4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the
near point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his
own rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low
slot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.

Skrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at
12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they
failed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive
power plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high
sticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The
Kings hit 3 goal post in the period.

3rd period:
The Kings used the phrase ""Initiate, not retaliate"" and it was very evident here
in the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames 
continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.

5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot
the puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to
cut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him,
wacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the
crease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net
where Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.

Sydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.

5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net
and passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the 
crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.

Carson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury
tripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where 
Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing 
a 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the 
Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at 
8:19) took penalties.  

5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near 
point, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the
net, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of
Hrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.

6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play
to seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone 
cut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed 
the puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass, 
beating Vernon on the ice, stick side.

At the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he
went after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single
minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames
right out of the game.

On the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey
as they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent
penalty killing.

On the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or
the Flames will surely get that power play back on track.

Notes:
------
The Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.

Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.

The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving
the opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.

Flames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon 
games.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power play
over their last 9 games.

The teams were 3-3-1 against each other in the regular season.

Well, actually, most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is
based on some fantasy of how it happened. But that's OK, I understand you
have a hockey background. Stats like ""plus/minus"" make RBI look good.


OK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to which
I'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please
answer yes or no, Roger:
 Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?
AL only, please.

For anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact
that a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the
team scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite,
hard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a
rule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,
for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.
So, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that
they scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other
things being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack
Morris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238
for Boston), the ""Red Jays"" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or
enough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola
pitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in
(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you
really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs
his team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this
analysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would
necessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but
that is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and
evaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that ""had Morris
performed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.""


This is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.

"I am currently attempting to get a copy of the HP Widget set compiled
under Linux (SLS Release with kernel 99.6) and am running into some
problems.  Actually, it seems that this is more of a GCC question,
because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000.
	Basically, there are a number of functions with prototypes
set up in, let's say, CompositeP.h, for instance, the composite
widget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type :

	typedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget)

but in several places in the HP source code, they reference the
insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just
one, as the prototype suggests.  For example:

	(*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w, args, p_num_args)

Now, GCC chokes on this, giving an error message that too many arguments
are passed to the function.  So, does anyone have any suggestions as to
how to turn off this checking in GCC, or how I can go about changing the
code to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h,
or has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions.
	Many thanks in advance for any help.

Devallano went earlier and more extensively to the Russian strategy

deal that sealed his fate.

Murray has made some decent trades...no doubt...but these are more
due to the stupidity or cheapness of other teams than brilliance on
his part...Washington was too cheap to pay Ciccarelli so they
essentially gave him away...and Carson was really a big anchor to
the team, and he was able to sucker a rookie GM to give him Paul
Coffey for deadweight.

If Detroit still fails this year because he was one defenseman short...
then he will have wasted an opportunity because Manson was available,

"There's only one way I know of to tell an AR-15 from an M-16.
   Pick it up, hold it about a foot from your face and look closely
   at the saftey lever.  If it has two positions, its an AR-15, if
   it has three, its an M-16.  There are numerous internal differences
   as well, but since one would have to field strip the weapon to see
   them, they are not valid in this discussion.  So, in conclusion,
   there is very little external differences to distinguish an AR-15

[ a lot of religious opinions and quotations from the Bible and from 
many Catholic theologians and Papal Bulls ]

[ which, although introduced with a smiley, was not as funny as it
might have been (notable exception: subject headers such as ""ONE'S 
DICK IS ONE'S INSTRUMENT OF REDEMPTION."" ]

[ and indeed, the posting seemed to be more a vehicle for the
religious text than for any ""literary/moral analysis"" ]

I am surprised and saddened. I would expect this kind of behavior
from the Evangelical Born-Again Gospel-Thumping In-Your-Face We're-
The-Only-True-Christian Protestants, but I have always thought 
that Catholics behaved better than this.

Friend Dennis, I urge you to follow the example of your fellow
Catholics, of who I count many dozens as my friends, and practice
your faith through good example and decent living and respect
for the common humanity of others. Please do not stoop to the
level of the E B-A G-T I-Y-F W-T-O-T-C Protestants, who think
that the best way to witness is to be strident, intrusive, loud,
insulting and overbearingly self-righteous.

The imagery in the Song of Solomon is a little bit dated (get it? 
Middle East - date palms - oh, never mind) but apparently acceptable, 
on a steaminess level, to be accepted as part of the canon. From
this fact I derive that erotica itself is not incompatible with
Catholic doctrine.

Is there such a thing as Catholic erotica? Not necessarily a love
story between people of that faith, but a love story that is not
exploitative, does not seek redemption through penis size, pays
proper respect to the dignity of each partner, and is still erotic
enough to have a place on a.s.s.

I would submit that the _Darknites_ series of stories qualify, also
most of the _Journal Entries_, and _Rings I and II_.

I would guess that your aim is to cut down on the pornography and
increase the erotica. I actually agree with you that nearly all of
the ""I've got an enormous dick, and I shot my wad all over her face""
stories are crap. I count them as noise, which makes my take on the
signal-to-noise ration much lower than many other people's.

Since you are one of the few posters here who can actually write 
decent prose, could you write a few stories for us instead of
overwhelming us with commentary?

Thank you.",19

Wait a minute, Doug.  I know you are better informed than that.  The US 
has never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada 
from the Cubans	to protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion 
of a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded, true (twice this century).  
Vietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess 
we ""invaded"" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have 
invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles 
for anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from 
Spain.

So if you mean by the word ""invaded"" some sort of military action where
we cross someone's border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally
""invaded"" carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation.
(If some nation ""invades"" the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be
invading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)  So from this point of
view, your score falls to 2 out of 6 (Mexico, Panama).

[...]

No, it's someone who believes in ""peace-at-all-costs"".  In other words,
a person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria and
Czechoslakia, but Poland too if it could have averted the War.  And one
who would allow Hitler to wipe all *all* Jews, slavs, and political 
dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone.

""Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace-nik,"" you ask?  Well, it depends
on what your values are.  If you value life over liberty, peace over
freedom, then I guess not.  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you
than life itself; if you'd rather die fighting for liberty than live
under a tyrant's heel, then yes, it's ""bad"" to be a peace-nik.

The problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who are
not like them to be ""bad"" and ""unconscionable"".  I would not have any
argument or problem with a peace-nik if they held to their ideals and
stayed out of all conflicts or issues, especially those dealing with 
the national defense.  But no, they are not willing to allow us to
legitimately hold a different point-of-view.  They militate and 
many times resort to violence all in the name of peace.  (What rank
hypocrisy!)  All to stop we ""warmongers"" who are willing to stand up 
and defend our freedoms against tyrants, and who realize that to do
so requires a strong national defense.

Time to get off the soapbox now.  :)

  Assuming that the bad guys can easily obtain substitute chips which don't

of the line (if there is any significant difficulty to obtaining such chips,
some of the criminals will decide to fall back on the murder/kidnap method).

 This assumes that the Feds are tapping Clipper phones belonging to ordinary
citizens (getting such a phone is the whole point of the crime under
discussion).  To be sure, I wouldn't put it past them -- but raising the
possibility of such crime has the benefit of forcing the Feds to either
'fess up about such intentions in advance or state that using Clipper
exposes the user to an additional criminal threat. <g>

"Ten years ago, the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter
of what it is now. Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on
NHL teams have escalated to the following stats:

Canadians: 400
Americans: 100
Europeans: 100

   Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top
25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.

   Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick
of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the
Red Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like ""Bure"" ""Konstantinov"" and
""Borshevshky"". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec,
and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other
teams is getting worse as well. 

    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about ""Pavel Bure, the
Russian Rocket"" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see
the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a
Canucks fan to begin with ;-). 

    Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that
I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and
some Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR
NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even
better hockey players. It's all hype. This ""European mystique"" is sickening,
but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue
to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.

    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly
only getting worse.

    I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures
and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.

    I just don't want them on mine.

There are two issues here:  copyright and patent.

The magazine article's contents are copyrighted, and may not be reproduced,
translated, etc., without the copyright holder's permission.  However, this
does not cover the *ideas* expressed, only the form of expression.  Copying
their circuit diagram or PC-board pattern is copyright infringement.  But
it's unlikely that they could stretch copyright far enough to claim that
the circuit design itself is copyrighted.  So long as you draw your own
diagrams and lay out your own boards, copyright shouldn't be an issue.

Patents are different.  The author does *not* have to give you any warning
that the design is covered by patent (although it would be sensible for
him to do so).  In fact, it's possible that *he* was infringing on someone
else's patent without realizing it.  Ignorance of the patented status is
not a defence against infringement, although it might reduce the damages
a court would award.

However... unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit,
almost certainly it is ""obvious to one skilled in the art"" and therefore
unpatentable.  Routine engineering is not patentable; patents (in theory)
cover only inventions, ideas that are genuinely new.

	Without having a complete answer to this question,  I should think
it obvious that the first step should be to convince people this would be
a desirable result.  There are still quite a lot of people who feel that
the command economies of eastern Europe failed due to corruption rather than
essential weaknesses of caommand economies,  and you still have a majority

I fail to see why you should feel this way in the first place.  Constant

Umm, is there any distinction between ""vague"" and ""elastic"" in this
context aside from one having a more positive connotation than the other?

Is that true?  I know some that won't even interview FMGs.  
Most programs discriminate, in that given an FMG equally
qualified as an American they will take the American.  What
rights do they actually have?  Does it matter if they are
US citizens (most are not)?  We have had good luck with FMGs
and bad luck.  SOme of our very best residents have been FMGs.
Also, our very worst.  As it turns out, the worst FMGs are often
US citizens that studied in off-shore medical schools.  Of the
5 residents fired for incompetence in the 12 years I've been here 
in my department, all have been FMGs.  3 were US citizens who studied 
in Guadalajara, 1 was a US citizen but was trained in the Soviet Union, 
and one was Philipina.  Unfortunately, all are now practicing medicine

[h] 	The Armenians in Nagarno-Karabagh are simply DEFENDING their RIGHTS
[h]        to keep their homeland and it is the AZERIS that are INVADING their 
[h]        territorium...
	
[HE]	Homeland? First Nagarno-Karabagh was Armenians homeland today
[HE]	Fizuli, Lacin and several villages (in Azerbadjan)
[HE]	are their homeland. Can't you see the
[HE]	the  ""Great Armenia"" dream in this?

Greater Armenia would stretch from Karabakh, to the Black Sea, to the
Mediterranean, so if you use the term ""Greater Armenia"" use it with care.

[HE]    With facist methods like
[HE]	killing, raping and bombing villages. The last move was the 
[HE]	blast of a truck with 60 kurdish refugees, trying to
[HE]	escape the from Lacin, a city that was ""given"" to the Kurds
[HE]	by the Armenians. 

It has always been up to the Azeris to end their announced winning of Karabakh 
by removing the Armenians! When the president of Azerbaijan, Elchibey, came to 
power last year, he announced he would be be ""swimming in Lake Sevan [in 
Armeniaxn] by July"". Well, he was wrong! If Elchibey is going to shell the 
Armenians of Karabakh from Aghdam, his people will pay the price! If Elchibey 
is going to shell Karabakh from Fizuli his people will pay the price! If 
Elchibey thinks he can get away with bombing Armenia from the hills of 
Kelbajar, his people will pay the price. 

It also seems other non-Azeri minorities in Azerbaijan have understood they
are next in line in this process of forced Azerification or deportation. Just 
look at the situation with the Lezgians.

About the Kurds...what Kurds! According to the Azerbaijani government, there 
are no Kurds in Azerbaijan. Can't they make up their minds? Oh I see, there 
are only Kurds when the Azeris want them to be Kurds! And anyway, this ""60 
Kurd refugee"" story, as have other stories, are simple fabrications sourced in 
Baku, modified in Ankara. Other examples of this are Armenia has no border 
with Iran, and the ridiculous story of the ""intercepting"" of Armenian military 
conversations as appeared in the New York Times supposedly translated by 
somebody unknown, from Armenian into Azeri Turkish, submitted by an unnamed 
""special correspondent"" to the NY Times from Baku. Real accurate!

[h]       However, I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane 
[h]       to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one
[h]       that happened last SUMMER. Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane
[h]       (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to ARMENIA.
[h]

No, Henrik, these Turkish planes should be shot down with no questions asked.

[HE]	Don't speak about things you don't know: 8 American Cargo planes
[HE]	were heading to Armenia. When the Turkish authorities
[HE]	announced that they were going to search these cargo 
[HE]	planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in Germany.
[HE]	5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of
[HE]	of the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not
[HE]	humanitarian aid.....

Your ""facts"" in error. Shipments of all kinds that have transversed Turkey 
have been either searched, re-routed or confiscated. Some American planes
were searched, others were re-routed, others were untouched. Rail shipments 
were held up last fall and last winter from entering Armenian from Turkey
for the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of Armenia. Wheat was
confiscated, other shipments were exchanged with ""crap"" and dirt, then
shipped to Armenia. U.S. planes don't have to use Turkish air bases. The U.S.
uses these bases to bomb Iraq. Anyway, U.S. planes can fly over Georgia, which
they have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of Turkish 
chauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed 
anything other than a paranoid Turkish military. 

[HE]	Search Turkish planes? You don't know what you are talking about.
[HE]	since it's content is announced to be weapons? 

Well, big mouth Ozal said military weapons are being provided to Azerbaijan
from Turkey, yet Demirel and others say no. No wonder you are so confused!

[HE]	Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons
[HE]	to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan
[HE]	it self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons
[HE]	since it's content is announced to be weapons? 

You are correct, all Turkish planes should be simply shot down! Nice, slow
moving air transports!

Of course if this question was asked in a group dealing with economics,
the answer would be that the cause of war was economic. My observations
over the past 30 years (and not withstanding a little history reading
beside) is that while religious differences do play a part in many of
the conflicts, so does (unfortunately) race, economics and any other
items that identify one group of men as being different from another.

If we want to couch the cause of conflict in Christian terms, I would
put it while Christ died for our sins, we are yet sinners. While some
individuals assume ""Christlike"" natures, most of us do not even
come close.

I realize that in many ways this is a trite answer, but I guess that
it is my way of rationalizing man's constant (or so it seems)

be an even *larger* percentage of people who have had homosexual erotic
fantasies.  But if less than 10% of the population is gay, what can we
say about these people who don't identify as gay but have demonstrated
gay potential.  Obviously, a large chunk of these people *chose* (or,
more accurately, were forced to choose by force of religion and social
sanction) to put those feelings aside, to be heterosexual.

   Obviously, Cramer and Kaldis fall into this category.

   These people are the ones who are so hung up on ""choice.""
Obviously, since *they chose*, everyone must have, and homosexuals are
just flaunting their ""perversion"" by choosing not to go along with what
society has dictated.

Precisely.  That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry.
Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius, you know, but for
some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  To
extend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competence
to beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a
weapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training
time the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years
practicing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one
(though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would
have an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of
training.  That makes firearms much better, in our eyes.


Excellent point.  Perhaps you aren't so naive after all?


Taken into consideration in what respect?  Though quite wrong, let's
make it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has been
taken into consideration.  We call use of them aggrivated assault,
assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted
murder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time.


In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered
your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and
shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few
world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons
tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  I'm curious, though,
were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, or
were they aquired by other means?  Any requirements other than just
registering the shotgun?


""Come on down to honest Erik's Used Swords!  Here's a slightly-used
short sword, *THE* battlefield supremacy weapon of the eleventh
century!  Only $39.95 with trade-in.  Easy financing!""  Sorry, I
couldn't resist.  You guys still slicing each other with long knives,
or is this really not a problem?


I'm all for that.  What gets me is that scandanavians (and yes, I'm only
a couple generations off the longship) used to be some of the most
feared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago, yet now seem to
spend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing.
Maybe you had a bit more time, and a more homogeneous culture, to become
civilized with?


Yes.  We're too damned violent, partially I believe because we are not
a homogeneous culture and don't identify ourselves as ""Americans"" first
and foremost.  I'm rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage,
whereas I suspect you couldn't care less about that 2% Welsh blood in
your veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055?  The time scale
and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a
basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good.
In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal
liberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but
I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict
individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd
hazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and
personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would
have sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture
we have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy
to identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmother
tells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke
""low Dane,"" whereas others spoke ""high Dane.""  It was shortly after
World War II, as I remember, that ""low Dane"" was abolished so there was
one common dialect.  We cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem,
because we have even more obvious means of identifying an ""outsider.""

[FARID] In support of the preservation of the territorial integrity of 
[FARID] Azerbaijan and its independence from Russian rule, the Iranians which 
[FARID] includes millions of Azerbaijanis will have Armenia retreat from the 
[FARID] territory of Azerbaijan. 

Oh, they will? This should prove quite interesting!

[FARID] To count on Iranian help to supposedly counter Turkish influence will 
[FARID] be a fatal error on the part of Armenia as long as Armenia in 
[FARID] violation of international law has Azerbaijani lands in occupation. 

Armenia is not counting on Iranian help. As far as violations of international
laws, which international law gives Azerbaijan the right to attack and 
depopulate the Armenians in Karabakh?

[FARID] If Armenian aggression continues in the territory of Azerbaijan, not 
[FARID] only there won't be any aid from Iran to Armenia but also steps will 
[FARID] be taken to have Armenian army back in Armenia. 

And who do you speak for? Rafsanjani?

[FARID] The Azerbaijanis of Iran will be the guarantors of this policy. As for 
[FARID] scaring Iranians or Turks from the Russian power, experts on present 
[FARID] and future military potentials of these people would not put much 
[FARID] stock on the Russain power as the sole power in the region for long!!! 

Well, Farid, your supposed experts are not expert! The Russians have had
non-stop influence in the Caucasus since the Treaty of Turkmanchay in 1828.
Hmm... that makes it 1993-1828 = 165 years! 

Oh, I see the Azeris from Iran are going to force out the Armenians from 
Karabakh! That will be a real good trick! 

[FARID] Iran is not alian to developing the capability to produce the A bomb 
[FARID] and a reliable delivery system (refer to recent news releases 
[FARID] regarding the potential of Iran). 

So the Azeris from Iran are going to force the Armenians from Karabakh by
forcing the Iranian government to drop an atomic bomb on these Armenians.

[FARID] The moral of the story is that, you don't go invading your neighbor's 
[FARID] home (Azerbaijan) and flash Russia's guns when questioned about it. 

Oh, but it's just fine if you drop an atomic bomb on your neighbor! You are
a damn fool, Farid!

[FARID] (Marshal Shapashnikov may have to eat his words regarding Turkey in a 
[FARID] few short years!). 

So you are going to drop an atomic bomb on Russia as well. 

[FARID] Peaceful resolution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict is the only 
[FARID] way to go. Armenia may soon find the fruits of Aggression very bitter 
[FARID] indeed.

And the Armenians will take your ""peaceful"" dropping of an atomic bomb as
an example of Iranian Azeri benevolence! You sir are a poor example of an 
Iranian Azeri!

a style that raises the level of posts on this board.  If you just don't seem

well.
	Having said this, I would like to ask in general for people on this 
board to realize that if they don't agree with the substance of posts, then they should respond to the substance (or lack of) of the posts rather than attack
the author of the posts.  When one has to resort to attacking a poster rather than what he/she has written, one can see that that person does not have the
ability to make a coherent argument concerning the post.

I am writing a mixed model application that creates a couple different

and changes behavior when I compile at different times.  The most common
problem is that all non-top-level windows fail to be displayed according
to their colormap.  My application starts out by creating three top-level
windows; in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be
displayed by their colormap.  This is spectacularly aggravating.

Ten questions to Israelis
-------------------------

I would be thankful if any of you who live in Israel could help to
provide
 accurate answers to the following specific questions. These are
indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by
people around me.

1.      Is it true that the Israeli authorities don't recognize
Israeli nationality ? And that ID cards, which Israeli citizens
must carry at all times, identify people as Jews or Arabs, not as
Israelis ?

2.      Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders
and that Israeli governments from 1948 until today have refused to
state where the ultimate borders of the State of Israel should be
?

3.      Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons ? If so,
could you provide any evidence ?

4.      Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of
individuals which were tried in secret and for which their
identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are
state secrets ?

5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the occupied
territories are subject to different laws than non-Jews?

6.      Is it true that Jews who left Palestine in the war 1947/48
to avoid the war were automatically allowed to return, while their
Christian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return ?

7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed
an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948, as is done today in
Bosnia-Herzegovina ?

8.      Is it true that Israeli Arab citizens are not admitted as
members in kibbutzim?

9.      Is it true that Israeli law attempts to discourage
marriages between Jews and non-Jews ?

10.     Is it true that Hotel Hilton in Tel Aviv is built on the
site of a muslim cemetery ?

Thanks,",17

Sure, why not? But, are you using Paul to correct the words of Jesus?


""So *anyone* who dissolves even one of the smallest commands and teaches
others the same way, will be known as the lowest in the kingdom of the
skies; whereas *anyone* who keeps the commands and teaches them too, will
be known as *someone* great in the kingdom of the skies."" Mat5:19 (Gaus)

Are you an ""anyone"" or are you a ""no one?""

Why not assume, that since Jesus didn't say that his words apply only to
Jews, that they apply to all human beings, irregardless of race or sex?

Why not assume, that even though Jesus did not mention your name, still
Jesus was talking directly to you?


Does it say that it applies to *you*? Are you anyone or no one?


Ex20:8-11(JPS) Remember the sabbath day and keep it holy. Six days you
shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of
the LORD your God; you shall not do any work - you, your son or
daughter, your male or female slave, or your cattle, or the stranger who
is within your settlements. For in six days the LORD made heaven and
earth and sea, and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh
day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and hollowed it.

Note: There is no specific requirement for worship here, however I for
one would not be so bold as to call these verses a ""ceremonial detail.""


Don't many Christians still practice circumcision?


It's unfortunate that Jesus didn't use your name directly, or maybe
Jesus did? Are you somebody or nobody?


If you don't see a problem, then perhaps there is none. As Paul closes
Romans 14 (Gaus):

  In short, pursue the ends of peace and of building each other up.
Don't let dietary considerations undo the work of God. Everything may be
clean, but it's evil for the person who eats it in an offensive spirit.
Better not to eat the meat or drink the wine or whatever else your
brother is offended by. As for the faith that you have, keep that
between yourself and God. The person is in luck who doesn't condemn
himself for what he samples. On the other hand, the person with doubts
about something who eats it anyway is guilty, because he isn't acting on
his faith, and any failure to act on faith is a sin.",15

1- US COMMERCIAL SPACE SALES FLATTEN IN 1993
   The US Department of Commerce projects US commercial space sales 
will remain flat in 1993, with current data showing only a 2 percent 
growth over 1992.  As published in ""US Industrial Outlook 1993"" 
(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space 
business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. 
   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had 
shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are 
driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are 
projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 
satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also 
projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, 
and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to 
$450 M, future sales will be ""adversely affected by the downward 
revision in Department of Defense launch plans.""                           
   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, 
revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to 
increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from 
broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products 
and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993
   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial 
space industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad 
report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite 
manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth 
$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual 
projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market 
sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very 
successful in regaining international market share in the satellite 
business. 
   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in 
the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-
year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including 
such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) 
appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually 
publishes a listing of  ""Space Business Indicators"" in mid-year, and 
the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released 
then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if 
the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the 
numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. 
   Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite 
promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top 
$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct 
broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite 
station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year 
through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic 
for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for 
substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the 
next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative 
assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and 
satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the 
current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite 
market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will 
be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive 
as currently projected.) 
   It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first 
release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research 
facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for 
the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space 
Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first 
sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] 

2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS
   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta 
launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola 
Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to 
launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO 
communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas 
was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. 
   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium 
constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium 
satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be 
launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle 
launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be 
launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  
Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a 
planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although 
details of the launch services contract were reported to be 
negotiation, and not yet final. 
   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of 
their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 
million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 
launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These 
launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global 
Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other 
programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is 
expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected 
to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  
Under this contract the USAF can also request ""launch on demand"" 
services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to 
occur within 40 days of the request. 
    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should 
provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program 
through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have 
a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and 
sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts 
for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA 
Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping 
MDC as a viable commerical launch company. 
    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these 
contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has 
not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for 
operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing 
and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these 
approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  
But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. 
   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of 
several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of 
the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III 
program in favor of the USAF NLS/""Spacelifter"" program.  At this 
time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future 
funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts 
is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy 
reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and 
Congress propose cancellation of all ""ELV upgrade"" programs 
(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed ""Spacelifter"" 
program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget 
deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to 
find in the shrinking US Defense budget.] 
 
3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC ""GO-AHEAD""
   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing 
satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of 
Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to 
WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and 
operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral 
images of the Earth. 
   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture 
by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the 
operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the 
request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new 
venture as a ""Star Wars"" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to 
provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into 
digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable 
customers for this service include exploration geologists, 
agricultural planners, and urban planners.  
   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the 
1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last 
November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote 
sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to 
this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to 
all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures 
would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. 
   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote 
sensing ventures working their way through the system at different 
stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite 
systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing 
data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, 
government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures 
such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use 
innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the 
margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures 
appearing in the next year or so.] 
                 
4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ ""STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT"" 
   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General 
Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, 
despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent 
analyst's report Morgan Stanley said ""We are more than ever 
convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical 
95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-
generating unit.""  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate 
management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are 
cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and 
$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of 
capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. 
   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has 
hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has 
restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, 
many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might 
be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space 
Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current 
problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected 
to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of 
about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space 
launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability 
of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits 
from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur 
program is back on track, this division will continue to show 
substantial losses. 
   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation 
is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  
To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional 
management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  
In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management 
team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with 
the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would 
indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch 
operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince 
customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would 
have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in 
marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for 
this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly 
McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash 
flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction 
(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), 
or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the 
$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of 
change for any company.] 
 
5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND
   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is 
projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early 
February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which 
detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the 
next decade. 
   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant 
position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 
international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane 
holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14 
contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long 
March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. 
   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can 
compete are projected to come from communications satellites with 
the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and 
scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand 
growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. 
   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of 
individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will 
continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with 
larger communications payloads carrying more transponders. 
Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications 
satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to 
about 3000 kg in GEO. 
   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain 
strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the 
decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace 
bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder 
demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques 
appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing 
or near-term transponders. 
   One of the significant possible changes in the market was 
identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian 
launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, 
investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade 
off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and 
other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities 
and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. 
   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and 
I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  
Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in 
the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new 
data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical 
transponders on orbit.
   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-
based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While 
fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the 
established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing 
demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-
multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space 
transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability 
service, but only from established point A to established point B. 
To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable 
between the points, and while there are improved network solutions, 
installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost 
millions or billions of dollars.  
   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground 
network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective 
solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is 
cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of 
thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite 
network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and 
has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is 
growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, 
it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to 
handle the increase in traffic. 
   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still 
growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But 
satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current 
generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of 
on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from 
last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch 
demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite 
launches over longer intervals. 
   And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it 
looks like the space transportation market will be rather over-
supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual 
commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites 
per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up 
to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of 
about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, 
Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other 
systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per 
year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market. 
   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial 
launches.]

6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT 
   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has 
spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety 
rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt 
the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation 
of range safety rules.  
   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of 
two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure 
typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at 
Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute 
before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was 
overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the 
communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the 
valid abort call. 
   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort 
command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an 
investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to 
launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. 
   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety 
Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This 
investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an 
incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their 
investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at 
lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used 
in the launch. 
  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an 
investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested 
by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space 
Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  
   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial 
investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are 
starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four 
different communications channels were in use during the test. After 
the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test 
director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops 
Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  
According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. 
Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the 
NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying 
the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing 
explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the 
best set being that clear lines of communications and clear 
definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and 
understanding of the mission rules were not established before the 
launch.  
   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these 
procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   
This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has 
been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they 
do with commercial aircraft problems).  
   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with 
procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance 
of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how 
specific lines of authority should be delineated.] 

7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED
   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new 
small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  
Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the ""Aerokosmos"" 
winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the ""Severkosmos"", 
launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is 
projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to 
an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 
kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used 
with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called 
'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military 
establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of 
spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the 
Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia 
facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. 
   [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new 
venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking 
for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house 
knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous 
commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. 
   This one's a little different in that they are offering variants 
of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being 
targeted or substantial financial backing.]

8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING
   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the 
results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial 
rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland 
Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary 
study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch 
site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected 
low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic 
considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal 
for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. 
   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the 
Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still 
proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland 
found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if 
substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected 
returns were too low to justify the cost of development.  
   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the 
feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:
  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage 
sufficient to recover setup costs?
  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?
  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?
  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the 
investment?  
   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at 
Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore 
Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against 
these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying 
on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]

9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING
   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush 
authorized space technology transfer for several joint space 
ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed 
use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that 
regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch 
vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first 
launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as 
a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into 
LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, 
including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  
Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in 
development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor 
launch vehicle as well as from the US. 
   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity 
in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small 
payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either 
Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  
However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout 
program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the 
Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on 
system).  
   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch 
system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of 
such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies 
have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche 
Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the 
Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to 
find any other European development work with even a rumor of 
funding for hardware. 
   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the 
Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting 
rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space 
launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled 
the country in the 1970's and early 1980's. 
   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally 
transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new 
civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de 
Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described 
as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket 
program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German 
firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq 
in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and 
tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package 
lagged that of the propulsion system. 
   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first 
scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B 
satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes 
cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has 
yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air 
launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this 
contract.] 

10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP
   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in 
late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract 
from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2 
launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar 
Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish 
Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and 
offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According 
to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya 
launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-
enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like 
the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as ""the main 
alternative rocket supplier"" for the small satellite launch service 
to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the 
Swedish satellite was not specified. 
   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and 
funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a 
small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From 
PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series 
rockets are built of ""off the shelf"" components based upon the Lunar 
MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a 
225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  
   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its 
first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and 
2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired 
TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary 
engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder 
closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same 
building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, 
launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. 
Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the 
board of directors.  
   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least 
$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been 
searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to 
design, build and launch their first set of vehicles. 
   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help 
bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need 
much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real 
hardware.] 

11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED
    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications 
venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  
As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), 
headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist 
Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China 
Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional 
communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite 
system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the 
satellite's communications channels.  
   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the 
release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid 
January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of 
Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg 
scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional 
satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has 
been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 
M) through 2006.  
   I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this 
venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  
While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the 
current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two 
separate sastellite ventures. 
   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is ""Asiasat-
2"", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing 
Hong Kong-based ""Asiasat"" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and 
other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational 
model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing 
venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to 
Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later 
satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between 
Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture 
through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to 
proceed. 
   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with 
substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This 
is just another indicator to add to the list.] 

12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES
   South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently 
announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and 
another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for 
advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been 
specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with 
manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by 
1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's 
aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by 
2000.                                 
   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its 
national aerospace industry, specifically including space 
activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are 
coming into the commercial space market. 
   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications 
satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 
on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide 
television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, 
southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. 
   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on 
Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US 
$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of 
this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely ""made in Korea.""  
Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-
monitoring micro-satellite. 
   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth 
observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) 
project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean 
government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with 
optical and microwave sensors.
   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel 
military effort to establish the capabilities for building and 
launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a 
government panel had been established to oversee such an effort, 
funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  
expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the 
Korean peninsula.       
   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean 
is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing 
aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is 
offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as 
part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of 
consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports 
satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has 
announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).  
   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  
Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector 
for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a 
South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition 
of commercial space market there over the next decade.] 

13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH
   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the 
results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and 
investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of 
March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the 
market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% 
of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a 
general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The 
increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which 
is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this 
trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite 
well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms 
which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its 
results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

FINAL NOTES - 
    What?  This column's already full?  And I still have bunches of 
commercial space developments to report on.  As I said at the start 
of this, column there's been a lot of interesting happenings - but 
I'll have to put them into the next issue.  
   Looking ahead, I've got several articles in the works on new 
happenings with Iridium and the LEO communications satellite market, 
more news on international launchers appearing (and disappearing) on 
the market, new international commercial space ventures,  and other 
interesting developments. 
   And as always, I hope you folks find this stuff useful and 
interesting -- Any and all comments are welcome.

Hi Adda,

Most Bible scholars agree that there was one copy of each book at a certain
time -- the time when the author wrote it.  Unfortunately, like all works
from this time period and earlier, all that exists today are copies. 


There are parts of books, scraps really, that date from around the
mid second century (A.D. 130+).  There are some complete books, letters,
etc. from the middle third century.  The first complete collection of
the New Testament dates from the early 4th century (A.D. 325).  Throughout
this period are writings of various early church fathers/leaders who
quoted various scriptures in their writings.


If you mean that someone discovered thousands of ""Bibles"" which were all
perfect copies dating from the last part of the 1st century...No!

If you mean that there are thousands of early manuscripts (within the
dates given above, but not letter perfect) and that the most probable
text can be reconstructed from these documents and that the earliest
original autographs (now lost) probably were written starting sometime
shortly after A.D. 50, then yes.


From the original authors.  We call them Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Peter,
Paul, James, and one other not identified.


As long as you make it.

"This is the official Request for Discussion (RFD) for the creation of two
new newsgroups for Microsoft Windows NT.  This is a second RFD, replacing
the one originally posted in January '93 (and never taken to a vote).  The
proposed groups are described below:

NAME: 	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup
STATUS:  Unmoderated.
PURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about
	 system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.

NAME:	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc
STATUS:	 Unmoderated.
PURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,
	 including issues such as security, networking features, console
	 mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.

RATIONALE:
	Microsoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family
	of operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish
	to argue about the meaning of an ""OS"").  The family ranges from
	Modular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to
	Windows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over
	50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the
	actual release is slated for May/June '93.

	While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares
	an application programming interface with the other members of the
	Windows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-
	dows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking
	and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for
	Windows 3.1.

	The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows
	3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses
	Program Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-
	sents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced
	Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and
	NT also runs existing 3.1 applications.

	Thus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following
	groups with the other members of the Windows family:
		comp.os.ms-windows.apps
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32
	
	The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as
	well as Windows 3.1:
		comp.os.ms-windows.announce
		comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy
	
	In conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the
	Windows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal
	structures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating
	systems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have
	undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate
	newsgroup hierarchies.

	Further, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --
	when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-
	generation Windows, ""Chicago"", debuts next year, surely it should
	remain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-
	tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?


DISCUSSION PERIOD:
	The discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  

VOTING:
	The CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on
	the feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will
	be accepted prior to the CFV.",2

Well, I'm not sure I'd use this to process a guitar but there was a audio
filter DSP construction article in the Sept 92 issue of QST magazine (Ham Radio
oriented).  The DSP is available in kit form for about $120.

This particular DSP filter was targetted toward processing audio to remove
noise (static).  I built it and it really works well.  The source code is
available too.  It makes a noisy audio signal much easier to hear.  Note that
this is for communication applications and is not ""high fidelity"".

I don't claim to be an expert on the branch Davidians, but I might know more 
than most.

The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots 
of a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now 
defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.

The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the 
SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they 
were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.

About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once 
in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as 
Christ.

Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young 
adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over 
the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.

They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of 
weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US 
government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were 
putting themselves in a self defense position.  

In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn'
t have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.

If you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the 
local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you 
some insight into where Koresh got his theology.",15

: The next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelites
: take Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except
: for Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports about

: the massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered
: me was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I
: shouldn't be so troubled about the reports of ""ethnic cleansing"" in
: Bosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims.
: Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians
: who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing
: God's work?

Perhaps it would be useful to ask whether those doing the ethnic
cleansing could be said to be loving those they are killing in the very
act of killing.  Does it reflect the attitude of God, who sends rain to
both the just and the unjust?  If not, then Christians should be
uncomfortable with it.  Jesus gave his followers the law of love to
follow and it is by exhibiting this that disciples will be known. 
Doctrinal (or political) correctness is not the standard, so I don't see
why Christians should be moved against the Serbs because their ancestors
converted from Christianity to Islam.  It seems to me that as a
Christian you _should_ be troubled by the ethnic cleansing.

All your article reflects is your abundant ignorance. The people of 
Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never 
abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally 
hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the
parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole 
perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July 
15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop 
Makarios.

Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with 
the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right 
given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently 
and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For 
those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island 
since 1571. 

The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization
of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the
'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not
forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks
in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to
destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of
course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences 
for this irresponsible conduct.


            THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM

2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus

It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at
the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched
against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat
Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally
killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage
Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the
24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities
committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which
has been converted into a museum.

AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY
GREEK TERRORISTS

The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the
Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been
going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men
and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal
Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage
bloodshed...

The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a
major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent,
are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the
bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their
home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.

Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by
Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded
during the same terrible event.

""On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan
and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.
Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.
Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting
having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River
direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.
Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was
dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought
would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in
the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We
waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing
in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her
arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.
Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house
with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard
voices saying, in  Greek, ""You want Taksim eh!""  and then bullets
started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children
fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,
who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I
heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.

When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and
her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the
neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what
had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to
the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was
brutally murdered.

In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying
""Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?""  I became terrified. I
thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not
dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself
under the double-bed.

An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My
mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some
water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the
bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I
offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who
were all wounded.

We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I
thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed
to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber
and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked
as far as Koshklu Chiftlik.

There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were
operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there
were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.
Ayshe and her daughter.

After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to
Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months
treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus,
Greeks arrested me at the Airport.

All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my
detention. They then released me.""

ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER

We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in
which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five
days.

We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some
terrible sights.

In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way
into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A
child's bicycle lay in a corner.

In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three
children piled on top of their murdered mother.

In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the
head.

This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose
family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.

Today was five days later, and still they lay there.

 THEY ARE TURK-HUNTING, THEY WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM.

 Discussions start in London; in Cyprus terror continues. Right now we
 are witnessing the exodus of Turks from the villages. Thousands of people
 abandoning homes, land, herds; Greek Cypriot terrorism is relentless. This 
 time, the rhetoric of the Hellenes and the bust of Plato do not suffice to 
 cover up barbaric and ferocious behaviors.

 DAILY HERALD (London)

 AN APPALLING SIGHT

And when I came across the Turkish homes they were an appalling sight.
Apart from the walls, they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bomb
attack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick
and concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately
fired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted
mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey
ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.

In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16 
wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From
this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village
did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.

 GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE

 Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the
 Turkish Sector of Nicosia, as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found
 crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios, 13 miles away, were
 brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment. Three 
 more bodies, including one of a woman, were discovered nearby but could
 not be removed. Turkish Cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to 
 locate the bodies of 20 more believed to have been buried on the same site.

Here's something I posted about this a few years ago.  It's not fully
up to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different
manufacturer's synonyms):

------
In practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view
of the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my
views on things like availability and backward compatibility):

74	The original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively
	obsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball
	functions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.

74H	Modification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher
	power consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.

74L	Modification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.
	Very obsolete; use CMOS.

74S	Later modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in
	power consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.

74LS	Combination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower
	power consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of
	devices.

74F	Fast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high
	speed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.

74AS	Failed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things
	that are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.

74ALS	Possible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly
	new, availability and prices possibly a problem.

74C	Fairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with
	4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer
	CMOS 74 families.

4000	(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS
	family, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low
	power consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.
	Very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,
	but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).
	There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The
	clear choice when speed is not important.

74HC	A new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power
	consumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for
	general-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.
	CMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of
	supply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power
	consumption at faster speeds.

74HCT	74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read
	the fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility
	in CMOS involves some compromises.

10K	(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources
	claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for
	serious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow
	the rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,
	can be expensive.

100K	(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and
	inconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.

As for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and
74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices

have to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible
with the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of
hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.

                PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT
                        WITH RUSSIAN PRESS
	     
                           Canada Place
                   Vancouver, British Columbia



2:46 P.M. PDT

	     	  
	     Q	  I had two questions for both Presidents, so you 
could probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll 
give you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  The first is that this is the meeting of the 
Presidents, so the money that's being promised is government 
money, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the 
government.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going 
to be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian 
businesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What 
are the priorities, because there are several association of 
Russian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to 
participate in setting up priorities for investment?  
	     
	     This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know 
that polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans 
are very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls 
say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times 
published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; 
42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent 
if it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to 
sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not 
very enthusiastic?  Thank you.
	     
	     Q	  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going 
to be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the 
answers.  Just the answers.  Okay.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is, 
it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example, 
the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will 
obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be 
good risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will 
be used to support the privatization of existing public 
enterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the 
Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have 
some influence over the distribution of.  
	     
	     With regard to your second question, let me say that 
I would think that there would be people in both countries who 
would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government 
giving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to 
that in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history 
there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That 
is, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole 
history of America, any kind of aid program has always been 
unpopular.  
	     
	     What I have tried to tell the American people is, is 
this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that 
this is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion --
trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments 
because of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in 
Russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them 
working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies 
going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it 
possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the 
economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and 
investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce 
nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on 
our side and on the Russian side.  
	     
	     So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an 
investment for the United States.  This is very much in the 
interest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the 
second stage of the program, which I hope to put together next 
week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for 
the taxpayers and workers of my country.  
	     
	     Russia is a very great nation that needs some 
partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share 
her goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view 
this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not 
what it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful 
investment.  
	     
	     Like all investments, there is some risk.  But 
there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than 
the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier 
of the Cold War.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, first of all thank you very 
much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory 
of the living correspondents, this is the first time an American 
President is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind 
of a very measured breakthrough.  
	     
	     I have two questions.  One, in your introductory 
remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief 
that you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you 
tell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to 
what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification 
of START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how 
confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager 
to support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions 
inherited from the Cold War?  
	     
	     PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of 
Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with 
regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent 
states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States 
develop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing 
that we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of 
the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude 
our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that 
would provide not only an important economic opportunity for 
Russia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out 
on our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed 
off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and 
we agreed to continue to press that.
	     
	     I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to 
reassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the 
Foreign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the 
United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine, 
but that, in order to do what we need to do together to 
strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States 
be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join 
the NPT regime is critical.
	     
	     What was the second question?  
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and 
COCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the 
Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will, 
as soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other 
restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on 
relations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies 
of the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of 
them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the 
leadership of the Congress.
	     
	     With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be 
an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there 
are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to 
emigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there 
is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed 
to affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be 
much less.
	     
	     With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing 
more than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my 
own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement 
out of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to 
begin it in the fairly near future.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in 
Annapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely 
different personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not 
political approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of 
Mr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the 
difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the 
difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of 
Mr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the 
last part of your speech?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to 
compare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say 
what was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a 
boy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the 
music and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been 
thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music 
for more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists 
and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know 
as much as I could about your history.  
	     
	     And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then 
the Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last 
presidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone 
in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr. 
Yeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I 
was following events there very closely and hoping for the day 
when we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a 
personal feeling about Russia.  
	     
	     I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like 
music very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a 
musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York 
Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony 
to the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly 
than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically 
so difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it 
occurred.  
	     
	     These are things that have always had a big impact 
on my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever 
had the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two 
countries become closer partners.  (Applause.)
	     
	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.",18

  Or you may be posting this WAY TOO EARLY and be eating your words by
  mid-season. C'mon, the Phillies haven't proved anything yet. Atlanta
  was similar to the Phils 2 years ago. They sucked. They started having
  a good year, but didn't get any respect until they actually won the
  division. (which is how it should be) So until the Phils AT LEAST   
  have a good year, not just a good 2 weeks, they won't get any respect
  either. BTW, Atlanta's .188 BA is actually a compliment to how good
  the Braves really are. Their record is 6-3. Can you imagine the Phils
  record if they were batting .188? hahahaha. And Atlanta's hitting will
  improve dramatically.  
  No, I'm not a Braves fan. Just defending a good team.

"Thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a
couple of the ideas. I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.
spec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C
and sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time
delay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this
application, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger
pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is
disabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.
When triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x
the timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can
be programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting
any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it
is, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K
resistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of
2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)
Of course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for
256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.
After the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14
day timing cycle and so forth.

Power is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the
electronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet
puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to
keep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to
work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts
to spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see
what I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that
has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns
off ;-)

Thanks again everyone...",12

	It is available through some dealerships, who in turn have to back
order it from the manufacturer directly.  Each one is made to order, at least
if you get a nonstandard length (standard is 5', I believe).


	See below


	I have a 6' long CobraLinks lock that I used to use for my Harley (she
doesn't get out much anymore, so I don't use the lock that often anymore).  It
is made of 3/4"" articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel cable.
It is probably enough to stop all the joyriders, but, unfortunately,
professionals can open it rather easily:

	1) Freeze a link.

	2) Break frozen link with your favorite method (hammers work well).

	3) Snip through the steel cables (which, I have on authority, are
		frightfully thin) with a set of boltcutters.

	For the same money, you can get a Kryptonite cable lock, which is
anywhere from 1/2"" to 7/8"" thick steel cable (looks like steel rope), shielded
in a flexible covering to protect your bike's finish, and has a barrel-type
locking mechanism.  I don't know if it's adjustable, but my source says it's
more difficult to pick than most locks, and the cable tends to squish flat
in bolt-cutter jaws rather than shear (5/8"" model).

	All bets are off if the thief has a die grinder with a cutoff wheel.
Even the most durable locks tested yield to this tool in less than one minute.

	FYI, I'll be getting a Krypto cable next paycheck.

"I produced an error last week about CHORION:


I abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from
others, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do
not feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in
this example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research
specifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not
as tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am
not competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns
out that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich ""Greek Lexicon"" renders
each verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical
order.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is
far from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes
things a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is
indeed ""chorion."" 

Now I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:

	""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Louw and Nida
	""Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament""
	""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Grimm
	""Word study Concordance,"" Tynsdale
	""A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other 
	 early Christian Writings,"" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich
	""The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,"" Perschbacher

In each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:

	A space, place, region, district, field, area, ""country place,"" 
	land, farm, estate, ""a bit of tillage"", and similar meanings.

Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about ""grave."" As some of these 
books go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books 
are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I 
think it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into ""contradictions"" to 
be once again, as your friend said it, ""lacking in substance,"" and thus Archer 
is again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would 
have honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them
to support Mr Archer's contentions). 

By the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of
""agros,"" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word
""agros"" is defined as ""a field in the country."" Chorion is specifically noted
as a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly
Bullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for ""field"" in Matthew
(ie: agros) is different from the word for ""field"" in Acts (ie: chorion), and
thus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already
admit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity
which drives the point home). 

So as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise
(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this 
particular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer
questions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and 
the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in
discussing the ""Potter's Field.""

"
   The following is from a critique of a ""60 Minutes"" presentation on MSG
   which was aired on November 3rd, 1991.  The critique comes from THE TUFTS
   DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER, February 1992.  [...edited for brevity...]

	""Chances are good that if you watched '60 Minutes' last November
	3rd [1991], you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] In
	the segment entitled 'No MSG,' for instance, show host Ed Bradley
	makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them
	('millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently
	sick'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven
	personal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the
	substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive 
	those studies are.

	Consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to
	a study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order
	to back up his comment that there is 'a lot of evidence' that MSG,
	a flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as
	in many supermarket items, causes headaches.  What he does NOT
	make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on
	humans but on rabbits.

	One of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist
	Patricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable that
	a small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get 
	headaches from it.  'But,' she explains, 'the show probably 
	overemphasized the extent of the problem.'

	A second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professor
	at the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradley
	remarks, 'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory
	animals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters' because
	it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney's
	research with lab animals does not 'show' anything about human
	youngsters.

	In fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney's 
	experiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected
	extremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing 
	their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly,
	and when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance
	to very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neither
	of those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG 
	with food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by
	enzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little
	reaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human
	blood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations
	found in Dr. Olney's lab animals.....

	The World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of
	that fact.  And so does the European Communities' Scientific
	Committee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies,
	have concluded that MSG is safe.

	Their determination makes sense, considering that MSG has never
	been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed
	to it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a
	burning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safe
	of clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently
	exonerated the much-maligned substance.

	That's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of
	monosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever
	we eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one
	of the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken
	down into glutamate during digestion.

	It's a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is the
	most abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makes
	up about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in
	milk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat.

	That doesn't mean it's entirely unimaginable that a small number
	of people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore
	sensitive to it...The consensus reached by large, international
	professional organizations [is that MSG is safe], the same consensus
	reached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large.""

Hey, it's better than the status quo.

I am far less worried about ""the feds"" tapping my phone than high school 
scanner surfers who get their kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and 
cordless phone calls.

It would be stupid to rely on even a ""Clipperized"" channel for truly 
sensitive material, but it *does* seem to finally offer a reasonable way to 
guard against casual eavesdropping.  For example, even with my strong ""right 
to bear arms"" view of the private right to possess and use strong 
cryptosystems, the system as described provides enough security that I would 
actually buy a cordless phone, and would be much less wary of using cellular 
phones, walkie-talkies, and so on.  As long as it's only used for mass-market 
voice scrambling, I actually don't see a problem with it.

If you want more security than it offers, use something different.  Use PKCS 
for electronic mail, CELP over DES or triple DES with Diffie-Hellman key 
exchange for your voice traffic, or whatever.

And yes, I'd rather just see all crypto restrictions lifted, but this is at 
least an incrememental improvement for certain applications...

Wasn't the beef with the English over ""taxation WITHOUT REPRESENTATION"",
not taxation itself?  

From my admittedly dim recollection of US history, most of the problems 
we Americans have had with taxes have been with unfair/unjust taxation
schemes, not with taxes themselves.  It's pretty hard to run a government
without any means of support.

"From the Santa Rosa (Cal.) Press-Democrat, April 15, 1993, p. B2:

    Male sex survey: Gay activity low

    A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough
    examination of American men's sexual practices published since
    the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2
    percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
    1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.

    The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday
    by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than
    the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional
    wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report.

The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners.
The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3.
Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson,
and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that
homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
male population.  It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for
straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically
how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are.",18

"Vera Shanti Noyes writes;


Of course I believe in Predestination.  It's a very biblical doctrine as
Romans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Church
has always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say
that I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free
will.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also
affected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and
Jansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with
the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). 
For God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect,
who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final
perserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those
without that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their
obstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need
it, as they had freely chosen hell.
							  ^^^^^^^^^^^
People who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own
effort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined
them to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish
because they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were
deserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and
sinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.


Well, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some
blessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little),
for those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And
those He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one
or in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal
punishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it
(cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder were
forgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And I
need not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement is
quite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred from
the Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira,
Jerusalem in 70 AD, etc.

not a >good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we
not >stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more

We should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but
does that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the
U.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am an
isolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But in
the case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily
involved, it would not be a ""just war.""  ""Blessed"" after all, ""are the
peacemakers"" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.  Our
actions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which is
unrelated to anything to justify it for us.",15

Yup.


Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to 
purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be
one of the following:
a) An employee of a government agency.
b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.
c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in
research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: 
The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.
Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction
and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.

The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any 
organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions 
to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:
- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the
location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. 
- The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft
within the operating radius around the launch site.
- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.
- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that
unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.

Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)
are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the
western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular
since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).

The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members'
use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is
from 50 to 500 or more feet. 

By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an ""F"" motor are exempt from
most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart
C, for details.

As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to
50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical
rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,
or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry
either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches
in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.

Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.


Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets
for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything
bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to
practice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs
takeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.


That's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE
ROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest
misconceptions people have about our hobby. 

True. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby, unless I get 
hit while crossing a road with a rocket in my hand. ",14

------------------------------------------------------------------
   		 NINETEENTH LETTER  

		 MU'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI 
A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW, Part 3       

(continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 2)

   THIRD SIGN:  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW)
are extremely varied.  Because his messengership is
universal, he has been distinguished by  miracles that
relate to almost all species of creation.
    Just as the supreme aide of a renowned ruler, arriving
with many gifts in a city where various people live, will be
welcomed by a representative of each people who
acclaims him and bids him welcome in his own language
so, too, when the supreme messenger of the Monarch of
Pre- and  Post-Eternity  (Ezel and Ebed  Sultani) honored the
universe by coming as an envoy to the inhabitants of the
earth, and brought with him the light of truth and spiritual
gifts sent by the Creator of the universe and derived from
the realities of the whole universe, each species of
creation -from water, rocks, trees, animals and human
beings to the moon, sun and stars- welcomed him and
acclaimed his prophethood, each in its own language, and
each bearing one of his miracles.
    Now it would require a voluminous work to mention all
his miracles.  As the punctilious scholars have written
many volumes concerning the proofs of His prophethood,
here we will briefly point out only the general category
into which fall fhe miracles that are definite and accepted
as accurate reports.
    The evidences of the prophethood of Muhammad
(SAW) fall into two main categories:  

    The first is called irhasat and includes the paranormal 
events that happened at the time of his birth, or before his 
declaration of prophethood.  

    The second group pertains to all the remaining evidences 
of the prophethood, and contains two subdivisions: 

    1) Those wonders that were manifested after
his departure from this world in order to confirm his
prophethood, and 
	2) Those that he exhibited during the era
of his prophethood.  The latter has also two parts:  
	2.1) The evidences of his prophethood that became manifest
in his own personality, his inner and outer being, his moral
conduct and perfection, and 
    2.2) The miracles that: related to substantial matters.  
The last part again has two branches:  
	2.2.1) Those concerning the Qur'an and spirituality, and 
	2.2.2) Those relating to matter and creation.  This last 
branch is again divided into two categories:  
	2.2.2.1) The first involves the paranormal happenings 
that occured during his mission either to break the 
stubbornness of the unbelievers, or to augment the
faith of the belivers.  This category has twenty different
sorts, such as the splitting of the moon, the flowing of
water from the fingers, the satisfying of large numbers with
a little food, and the speaking of trees, rocks and animals
Each of these sons has also many instances, and thus
has, in meaning, the strength of confirmation by
consensus.  
	2.2.2.2)  As for the second category, this
includes events lying in the future that occured as he had
predicted upon Allah (SWT)'s instructions.  Now starting
from the last category, we will summarize a list of them.(1)

(1) Unfonunately, I could not write as I had intended
without choice, I wrote as my head dictated, and I could
not completely conform to the order of this classification.

"Everyone keeps talking about European expansion by 2010 thinking
wishful thoughts, but being totally off the ball.

The league format we use here is incompatible with that in Europe.
(for those that don't know, the best teams from lower divisions get
promoted and the worst get demoted).

Would European fans put up with our ""if you've paid, you can play"" 
attitude??

How long would they support teams that are run on Ranger-based 
corporate thinking (I use the term lightly).  (We don't need a good
product because these duffuses in NYC would fill the arena for Ottawa's
record every year......1940!! haha (sorry, had ta say it)).

If hockey (and other pro sports) had a similar system to Europe, maybe
teams like the Rangers would be forced to compete (or get demoted the fourth 
division).  We'd have many more teams...centres that aren't as big (like
Halifax or Adirondack....ok, so Halifax isn't a good example) would 
eventually get promoted, and every team would be somewhat competetive within
its own division (unlike Ottawa, SJ, Edmonton, etc.). Fans would eventually
get rewarded for their loyalty (or penalized for their neglect), and the
league would be more interesting and dynamic every year because of the influx
of newly promoted teams (and the Halifax Citadels win the Stanley Cup...I can
dream, can't I??)

problems).

I don't meant to defend Eric Molas- I find it somewhat annoying when
someone pops up on alt.atheism to tell us all about his (usually
atheistic) beliefs, so I can certainly see how Christians might be
annoyed- but I'd like to point out a few things.


""no meaning from God"" is not the same as ""no meaning"". From my (atheistic)
point of view, if you want meaning in your life, you get to go and
get some or make some.

No free gifts of meaning. (I never quite understood how any
God can just ""give"" your life meaning, actually. If he
says you exists to do or be X, that gives you a purpose
if you care to accept it, but is that the same thing? But
I digress...) 


This would truely be a miserably existance, which I doubt Eric
endures. Life can be enjoyable, so you can live it because you like
it, or purposefull, so you can live it to get something done. One should
endeavour to make it so, if it is not. Otherwise it would be as you say.
Terrible.


Probably true. Remeber he almost certainly sees that particular joy as
an illusion, and does not want it. So maybe it isn't so bad?


As an atheist, I am free to be a human person. I think, love, choose,
and create.


Ah, now here we begin to diverge. I will not live forever
with anyone.

(I don't think you will either, but you are welcome to your
opinion on the matter.)


I tend to agree with you.

It's my opinion that (unlike drugs) religions are normal
parts of human societies.

I think they have outlived their usefullness, but they
are evidently quite ordinary, normal things that haven't
proved lethal to humanity yet.


I have heard this claim quite a few times. Does anybody here know
who first came up with the ""God-shaped hole"" business?


You might want to provide some evidence next time you make a claim
like this.


I don't know Eric, but I do not think it is wise to assume he has a less
joy-filled and abundant life because he holds certain beliefs.

I don't understand what you are getting at here.  If the chances of 
promiscuity are larger, yet the rate of promiscuity is lower in the heterosexual
community, doesn't that imply that the homo/bi sexual population is then 
even more promiscuous than the raw statistics imply?  
(No axe to grind here I'm just a scientist and I hate to see statistics abused.)


I am a hetero man and have had sex with one woman in my life (my wife).  It is 
very pleasing to me to be able to say that.  I hope you have the same feeling
as I do.  I also wish that you could (if you wanted) experience the joys and
trials of being committed to someone for life (there is something about marriage
that makes the commitment much greater than one might expect).



Don't forget about the culture.  Sadly, we don't (as a society) look upon
homosexuality as normal (and as we are all too well aware, there are alot
of people who condemn it).  As a result, the gay population is not encouraged
to develop ""non-promiscuous"" relationships.  In fact there are many roadblocks
put in the way of such committed relationships.  It is as if the heterosexual
community puts these blocks there so as to perpetuate the claim that gays 
are immoral.  ""My, if we allowed gays to marry, raise children ... we might
just find out they're as moral as we are, can't have that can we?""

bit of oil when new - max maybe .4 quart in first 1000 miles; this soon quits
and by the time I had 10,000 miles on them the oil consumption was about zero.
I've been told that the harder you run the bike (within reason) the sooner
it stops using any oil.

Gee, you'd think Winnipeg would be tops on that list, what with 8 regulars

Well, being a Jet fan, I sometimes wish that Bure would get knocked silly
too.  (Nothing serious, just enough to keep him out of a game. :)



In most cases, the owners have very little to do with it.  They give their
general managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best
players so that our team will win the Stanley Cup.  Whether that player is
in Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him
to be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.

Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian
players.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners
can do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable
here in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US
that the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their
import ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.

Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would
make players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the
lower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some
that play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm
club, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on
the secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian
players in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.))
So with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players
in North America.


I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the
world.  I've grown up with Europeans playing on 'my' team, and some of those
players were the among the best in the world.  From Hedberg, Nilsson, and
Sjoberg, to Sel{nne, Zhamnov, and Olausson, and all those in between and to
come, I wouldn't have it any other way.",10

[Stuff deleted]
 


Will, there has been a lot of discussion going on about this over in
s.r.c.b-s.
I will make the case here though and try to help you out:

8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it
is the gift of God:
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.
(Ephesians 2:8-9).

Yes, it is by God's grace and our faith that we are saved.  We are not
saved by what we do.  However,

15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.
(John 14:15).

Keeping Christ's commandments is a ""work"" per se, and a demonstration of
our love for him.  Also,

6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his
vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.
7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years
I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why
cumbereth it the ground?
8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I
shall dig about it, and dung it:
9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it
down.
(Luke 13:6-9).

Again,

16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye
should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that
whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.
(John 15:16).

It is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit. 
What is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being
love, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest
in the actions that we carry out.

If a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things
Christ commanded, I dare say, that they really don't have any faith. 
Asking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade
on a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your
pants is more important.

Good works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith,
true faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable
above speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs
commands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit,
then we shall be uprooted just like the tree. 

It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions
prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk for
days about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a
building and not hit the ground.  In other words, I can sit and tell you
all day long that I have faith in my ability to fly.  I really don't have
that faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the
test.  Words and talk mean nothing.

I could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will, but
this should be sufficient.

Hope it helped.

Jon

Subject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis


To:  shaig@Think.COM

Subject: Ten questions to Israelis

Dear Shai,

Your answers to my questions are unsatisfactory.

In the answer to my first question, concerning the nonexistence of
Israeli nationality, your answer conflicts with information I have
received from other quarters, according to which there are two
distinct categories of classifying Israelis:  Citizenship
(Ezrahut) and Nationality (Le'um). The former is used on passports
etc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I
am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all
times and present them at many public places, almost every day.
These ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab.
You maintain that this mainly because of religious services
provided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ?
Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it
serves no other purpose ?

In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that
Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were
'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I
read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had
plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into
Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of
Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was
established, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for
later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the
fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the
land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God
promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the
borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use
today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what
it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a
base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one
cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a
number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).

Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public
official. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to
Vanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without
evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said
the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why
should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.

Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning
'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from
Ma'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do
exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?

You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a
way to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been
used by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet
Union into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they
would not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are
clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be
very happy if you could convince me that what I am told about
Israel were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so.
I suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest
discussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.",17
"I am considering buying an new car, so I called three insurance
companies in California to get estimates. I asked for the same

what I found (for a '93 Integra GS):

State Farm: 2614.92/yr.
Allstate: 1220/yr.

AAA is non-profit, so they said I could also expect to receive about
$200-300 back at the end of the year.

Still, There is a huge gap between all of these companies. State Farm

"I know it's a long shot, but maybe someone went through this and will have
some comments to share.

The story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I'm trying to get
the safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has 
aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather
weak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.

The inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a
waiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the
officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a
waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to
show me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He
showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if
you can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told
him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book
and said ""It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you
a ticket for it right now."" Well, won't argue with that...

Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the
tint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the
library).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police
that says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't
get in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering
a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.

So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from
the police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience
registering a complaint against an officer? I called the station 
later on today, but they basically said there is no place where I
could register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide
to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do
I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?

Any comments about it will be welcome!",7
